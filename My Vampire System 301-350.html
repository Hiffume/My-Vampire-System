<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others were a
little too far to see just what was genuinely happening. They stood
just outside the booth and were watching from both sides. One side,
with Quinn's group on the left and the other side with Zac's group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of their team's
stood behind their teammates, which meant Quinn had his back facing
against Fex, so even with his excellent eyesight, he didn't know what
was going on and was unable to see that the influence skill was
currently active. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had never even
thought about using the influence skill to get rid of this whole
matter. Zac Being a level 6 ability user usually meant one would have
a strong mind and will power, this wasn't always the case but more so
than not. In the past, something like this would have never worked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, there were
two things that had changed since the last time. The first being that
Quinn had increased his charm points quite a bit. The second was due
to the pressure and frightening things that had happened so far,
Zac's mind was very unstable. He didn't quite know what was going on,
and because of this, the influence skill had a great effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're going
to leave that crystal behind and leave this place,&quot; Quinn
ordered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment, Zac
obediently followed, pulling the intermediate crystal from his pouch
and placing it on the floor. Soon after, he already left, and the
others followed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, that
went a lot smoother than I thought it would,&quot; Fex said </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After picking up the
crystal and placing it in his pocket, his mood had calmed down, and
his eye colour had returned to normal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, that was
fun, wasn't it.&quot; He said, facing the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Vorden
felt like Quinn was acting a little bipolar. Just moments ago, his
voice sounded like he would snap Zac's head apart, but now he seemed
to be over the moon. However, Vorden didn't say anything as he really
wasn't the one to talk about a person having mood swings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, the admin
man had entered the room; the other student had left to join the
others when he saw Zac and them going. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What
happened?&quot; The man said with his hands held above his head. The
top part of the machine was smashed to bits. It was beyond repair. A
whole new machine would need to be ordered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We should have
told those guys to stay behind.&quot; Said Fex. &quot;Now, we're
going to get the blame and have to pay for this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man was about to
tear them a new one. Telling the kids how they should respect the
property that wasn't owned by them, but when seeing the large number
in the room, indicating which booth this was, he quickly realized it
was the same one from the video. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you do
this?&quot; The man asked, looking at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video that was
shown was from the top right. In the video, one was unable to see the
face but could see all the actions performed. The only thing that
could be seen was the black curly hair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, it was
me,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, you idiot.
Why do you have to be so honest, just say it was the others who ran
away.&quot; Fex said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They have the
incident on video anyway,&quot; Sam said. &quot;On the video, there
will be no proof that the others did anything and would just show
Quinn kicking the top part. So it's best not to lie.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students stood
there worried for Quinn, the man was quite large, and they were
afraid of the consequences they might have to face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you need
to, I can pay for the machine.&quot; Vorden offered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can chip in
as well,&quot; Fex added. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Me too,&quot;
Sam replied, feeling a little awkward if he didn't offer as well
after everyone else had done. But he wasn't rich like the others, and
really didn't want them to take him up on his offer </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man looked at
Quinn. If he was the one in the video, it was expected that something
like this might have happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You have good
friends. Accidents like this can happen. Don't worry about it, and
don't let it happen again.&quot; The man said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were shocked at
the response but decided to try to leave as soon as possible and not
argue back with the results. There was a good chance that the man
might change his mind, so they quickly decided to leave the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Make sure I
don't see you here again!&quot; the man shouted at them with a smile.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The four boys were
back out at the platform, and the night sky was now fully out. The
stairs could be seen above them, and it looked beautiful. Most of the
students who were on the platform before had already headed back to
their hotel to get some sleep. Although there was no curfew, students
were expected to watch the matches that started early in the morning.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group continued
to walk in a circle on the platform and reached Sam's hotel. Before
parting ways, Sam wanted to get as much information out of Quinn as
possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You were
really skilful back there. I can't believe what you did. You know, I
feel slightly embarrassed now that I offered to help you when you
didn't really need it.&quot; Sam said, laughing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about it,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;You offered to help even though
you didn't know us. In this world, there aren't many who would do
that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you don't
mind me asking, how did you do that with the machine earlier, how can
you move so fast? is it something to do with your ability?&quot; Sam
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought a bit
about what to say before answering, but he knew he couldn't take too
long otherwise Sam would get suspicious. Still, he didn't see Sam as
a bad person but still couldn't tell him the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't have
an ability, that's why it shows I'm a level one. Because of this, my
parents trained me on how to fight since I was young. I focused just
on using martial arts. I thought if I got good enough and got some
decent beast gear, then maybe I can still make it in this world.&quot;
Quinn explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'He's getting better
at lying. I don't know if that's really a good thing, though.' Vorden
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the group
continued to talk for a bit before parting ways. Sam headed back to
his hotel room, while the others continued to walk to their own
hotel. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Saying one has no
ability is a good way to hide your actual ability. It's a shame you
won't be participating in this tournament, Quinn. It would have been
able to see you up against Nate.' Sam thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although he couldn't
confirm Quinn was the Bloodevolver, he didn't really need to. The
main thing was, Sam felt like he had got on well with Quinn. If he
were actually the Bloodevolver it would only make things more
interesting. There was no rush on his end. There was still a week
left to try to find out the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back at the gaming
area, the Admin who had let Quinn and his group go was ago in the
camera room. He had finished cleaning up the bits and pieces and had
closed off the booth to be used by the public. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the room, he
watched Quinn's video fighting against the Level four machine again.
Every time he watched, he got excited. He also further watched what
had happened after the events, seeing that Quinn had saved his fellow
teammate and kicked the machine out of harm's way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I was right to not
blame them for what happened.' He thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, there was
another reason why the man had let them go without paying for
anything. The video had been cut down, only showing Quinn's actions
during the level four game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, once the video
file was downloaded, the man went onto one of the students' internal
video sharing platforms and clicked upload. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A bar started to
fill on the screen, and the number eventually reached 100 Percent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This video
doesn't deserve only to be seen by me.&quot; The man said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon, all the

Silver</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Arriving at the
arena, Silver felt better than she had done in a while. It had been a
long month and a bit spent at the academy military base. She wished
to return home but would never do so until she had completed her
task. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that it felt
like she was drawing close, her mood was starting to change. As she
left the hotel room to head outside she passed many of the students
she had taught. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I hope you
have a good day miss.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wish I look
as pretty as her when I grow up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students
couldn't help but praise Miss Silver. Although she had been strict in
class her lessons were quite knowledgeable. Her lessons were also
enjoyable as it seemed like when Silver taught, she had no filter.
When speaking she would never sugarcoat her words like the other
teachers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the middle of the
class, the boys would often compliment her or ask her about certain
subjects, when replying she would do so bluntly, embarrassing them
and speaking what was on her mind. As days went on the students
started to learn what Silver was like and realized she meant no harm
from her words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, she found
the compliments annoying but over time she grew to enjoy the words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'When I go back,
will father praise me for doing a good job?' She thought. Everything
she had done so far was for the family and she would continue to do
so. Yet not even once, had her father the family leader praised her.
Unlike here where she heard kind words every day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before she knew it,
she had already left the arena and was just outside on the ground
floor. It was a habit for her to want to be alone whenever she got
upset. Usually, a few moments later and her idiot of a brother Fex
would come and cheer her up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After she had calmed
down, her plan was to head back into the arena and search around on
the top floor to see if she could find any information or maybe even
spot Fex. The quicker she brought him home the less time she would
have to spend here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, a strange
sweet smell had reached her nose, one she was familiar with but
hadn't smelt in a long time. The smell of blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Wondering why she
would smell the scent of human blood outside, she quickly rushed over
to the scene. Eventually, the trail of blood led her to a bald-headed
man, with a sword by his side. When she saw that no one was hurt, she
slowed down her stride and started to walk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The smell was still
coming from the direction of the man, and that's when her eyes were
glued onto a particular object he held in his hand. It was a metallic
flask, but not just any flask. A flask that bore the symbol of the
Sanguinis family. Knowing that Fex was at one of the academies, her
mind instantly thought the flask belonged to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The question was,
why was this man holding onto Fex's flask that was filled with blood.
From his scent alone she could tell he wasn't a vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where did you
get that flask?&quot; Silver asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo tried to see if
he could recognize the voice but it was not one he knew off. He was
quite new to the military so he still hadn't memorized all of the
other generals and sergeants aura or voices either. But if one was
able to get into this facility, he had to assume they were a member
of staff. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Yet, the first
question she asked when meeting him was about the flask. Judging by
the tone of her voice she had to be either someone of equal rank or
someone above. No student would dare talk to a sergeant like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who are you?&quot;
Leo asked. &quot;State your name and rank?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Leo had
spoken, the words didn't really process through Silver's mind. She
was too concerned with her own question. Fex would have never let
something so precious fall into the hands of another unless something
serious had happened. Did the humans find out about him and kill him?
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Regardless, the
flask was an important piece of equipment that could possibly link
the humans to them, she needed to get rid of it. Flicking out one of
her fingers, a small piece of string shot out straight, aiming for
the flask in Leo's hand, not wanting to cause a scene she would take
the flask and try to find out more later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The piece of string
was so thin, and it was dark outside making it practically invisible,
but before the string could even reach the flask, a slicing sound was
heard, and then a short click followed after. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The piece of string
then fell onto the floor. When looking at Leo, she could see the
flask had now been put away into his side pouch, while his hand was
on the hilt of his sword. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You cut the
string, but how did you see it?&quot; She asked, shocked by what had
just happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Silver wasn't
the only one shocked. He was surprised that the girl was also able to
see him move his sword so fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I didn't,&quot;
Leo replied as he pointed to his eyes with his other hand. &quot;Can't
you tell? I'm blind.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo expected at
least a chuckle from Silver, usually, these types of words would at
least give him a response. Instead, Silver stood there still like a
statue, not even her expression had changed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When checking out
her aura, there wasn't even a little flicker, and still, her aura
seemed to be masked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you're
blind, then I don't have to worry about you seeing my face.&quot; She
said as she dashed forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Withdrawing his
sword from his sheath, a large pressurized air slice game out from
the sword. Sensing the strong power that was just unleashed, Silver
knew she needed to do something about it. One moment she was directly
in front of Leo, the next she was behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver struck
towards his chest, thinking the whole thing would be over, but as if
Leo had eyes on the back of his head, he was able to dodge by ducking
down. He then pivoted his foot spinning his body around while
throwing out his blade towards the middle of her body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time, the
attack was too fast for her to move, instead, at just the right time,
she opened up her palms and slapped at the sword from the bottom and
the top. Using all her strength she was able to stop the sword just
in time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sword was held
in her hands, just a few inches away from her body. From the outside
it looked like neither one of them was moving an inch. But the truth
was, they were both using their full strength but their power was
equal not allowing the other one to budge. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is this her natural
strength?' Leo thought. 'I've even activated the beast armour
underneath my clothing and still, I can't overpower her.' From Leo's
ability, he was able to tell if his opponent had high-level beast
gear that was currently activated to enhance the user's strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a
possibility that the opponent he was fighting against was able to
mask their equipment as well but it was unlikely. The stalemate
continued for a while but both knew this was useless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Your voice
sounds pretty, if it sounded as good as you looked, I might let you
win this one,&quot; Leo said, hoping to break her concentration for
just a second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it didn't
seem to work. Instead, her eyebrows and face started to scrunch up.
She started to concentrate even more and the top of her forehead
started to sweat a little. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver hadn't run
out of options, she still had her many Vampire abilities, the problem
was quite a few of them required her to look into her opponent's eyes
and that didn't quite work well against Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Other than that, the
blood abilities would be a dead give away and would leave behind a
trace. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead, she chose
to push her body even further, ever so slightly. With one of her
hands, she carefully positioned her fingers so now it was held both
on top and under the blade. Then slowly with her other, she let go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, Silver was
holding back Leo with a single hand, but she knew she couldn't do
this for long. With her other hand free, quickly she started to twirl
her fingers, and multiple strings started to shout out, the target
wasn't Leo himself, but instead, they were heading for his pouch. The
first set of strings lifted it open, while the next grabbed on to the
flask. After slightly moving her finger, like a web she was able to
draw it into her hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't make me
come back to kill you.&quot; She said, as she quickly fled the scene
at an amazing speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo prepared himself
to perform another quick set of slashes. If he threw out multiple
strikes now there was a chance one of them could hit her and slow her
down. Midway through his attack though he stopped himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'She couldn't have
come all this way just for that. It seems whoever owned that item is
quite important.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From the location of
where the flask was found and the story of the other students, he
could tell that the flask most likely belonged to one of them. He had
planned to return it at one point, but not until he fully found out
the Flasks use. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He never did in the
end. But now he felt like he had a more interesting tale to follow. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first day had

day of events. The schedule was like so, each day, the first round
for every category of events would happen. Several smaller events
would take place at the same time. In comparison, the three main
events would be shown one by one. </FONT></FONT>

themselves about the ongoing news. It would also allow them to

the energy was drained from her. One wouldn't expect this type of
reaction from some of the participants, as they really cared for an
event like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But for Layla, this
was not the case. She had no reason to care for the tournament, win
or lose it didn't matter. Her life was already predetermined. She
wasn't going to get good grades and join the military or a faction
after this. She couldn't even become a solo traveller if she wanted
to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This became more
apparent to her last night, and this was the real reason why she felt
like this. Last night she had hardly gotten any sleep. When entering
her room, she had prepared to have a nice rest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She had made a warm
bath and placed the right amount of bath salts and solutions into the
tub. She had never experienced pampering like this and just wanted to
enjoy it for once. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, fate was
quite cruel to her. The sound of a message being received was heard
on her computer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'That's strange. I
didn't sign into anything right. I don't think I even touched the
computer. Maybe the person before forgot to log out?' She said as she
started to walk over. However, even the thought of someone forgetting
to log out was strange. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Technology had come
quite a way, and the computer was able to tell who was actually at
the computer at the time through the camera. If it wasn't the correct
person or the user wasn't seen, it would generally disconnect from
whatever it was connected to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, this just
made Layla even more curious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When she looked at
the screen, her heart felt like it skipped a beat. The towel she had
covering herself had fallen out of her hands, and she didn't even
bother to cover up her bare naked body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the computer
screen was an envelope with a crest attached in red. It imitated the
letters from the old times when wax used to be used to seal essential
letters. In this case, the seal being used was an angel with its
wings having been removed falling to the side. It was a letter from
Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had their ways
of getting information to their members, Pure, in reality, was a much
bigger and more influential group than the government would have
liked the public to know. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla's hand was
shaking as she went to select the Letter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What could they
want now, do they want me to do something, maybe even attempt to
assassinate someone?' Thoughts were running through her head. There
were many different tasks an agent needed to do, and she felt quite
lucky when they told her to just gather information about the academy
as she saw fit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Letter could
very well be her first real mission. Eventually, she plucked up the
courage and clicked on the Letter, the digital screen imitated the
seal being open and the contents of the Letter were shown. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Agent 100, you
have been ordered to lose and drop out of the tournament as soon as
possible.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The contents of the
Letter were short, and it didn't expand on instructions or even
explained why, it was merely telling her to purposely lose her next
match. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her bath time was
ruined, and her whole night for that matter. The task was an easy
one, and she was thankful for that. She wasn't really going to try in
the event anyway. Still, she couldn't help but wonder why it was so
important for her to drop out of the event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing it
would allow her to do was a return to the others side. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Are they planning
an attack?' This dreaded thought had now chilled her mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If they weren't
planning an attack, they were planning something big. Every year this
event took place and so far they had never targeted it. It was
expected at some point they would, and this might very well be the
year. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Having arrived at
the target practice area, Layla started to notice something strange.
The other students seemed to be hurdled up in groups and were talking
about something. She was able to catch a few words here or there, and
she had also expected them to be talking about their upcoming events.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey did you

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, it went

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you think
you could do that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But it
happened here. It was one of the students from the bases. Look at the
date and time stamp, and even in the description they mentioned what
had happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's what I
don't understand, though. Clearly, this person was a skilled fighter.
But if this happened yesterday at the arcades up top, then that means
he isn't a participant in any of the events. Even if he had a weak
ability, there is even a martial arts event. Heck, there's an event
based on this very game. So why didn't he join.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without any context
to what the students were talking about, Layla was perplexed and was
quite curious as well. That's when she heard her name being called
out from behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Layla!.&quot;
Logan shouted. &quot;Do you have a second?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Logan had
left his room, he had been looking around to try to find Layla,
trying to see if she had heard or seen the video herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing upright,
trying to make herself look energised, Layla turned around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Judging by you
not saying anything I guess you haven't seen.&quot; Logan then placed
out his hand, and the little spiders from his suit started to detach
themselves until eventually, they formed a small screen and tablet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video was a
recording of one of the gaming booths from the top left corner. The
student was angled, and the camera was positioned slightly behind so
one could see the machine as well as the student's fast hand
movements. What was shown was a student being able to clear a level
four game, while the machine itself looked like it hadn't moved an
inch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had tried one
of these machines before and could see how impressive it was. In the
video, the figurehead had been altered and blurred thanks to the
uploader wanting to keep the person's identity a secret. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's cool and
all, no wonder everyone is talking about it, but why did you want to
show it to me so badly?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then gave a
command to his little spiders, to alter the video. The blur from the
person's head was removed, and now curly hair with a pale skin could
be seen. It was still hard to see the student, but for those who were
around him a lot, she could tell who it was. </FONT></FONT>

already spread around, and it looked like many in the room were
already talking about it. The feat itself wasn't so impressive but
the fact that a student of their age was able to do such a thing was.
In the game, no abilities could be used, and some were even beginning
to think the person in the video must have had some type of speed
ability. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, gaming
systems usually had some countermeasure against abilities being used
in this type of place and this was no exception. Due to the event not
allowing the use of abilities, trackers and such were invented to see
when MC cells were activated in a specific area. It was the same type
of technology that was used in the watches. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate was hoping that
perhaps someone as skilled as the Blood evolver would be well known.
To the point where if he went around asking others from the same
military school, they would have instantly recognized the name. This
was why he continued to go about asking students from other military
factions if they knew of the person named &quot;Larry.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far there was no
success. Out of all the students who were preparing for their events,
the students taking part in the fighting tournament were the most
cautious. Everyone there was trying their best to hide their
abilities and instead was doing some other form of training. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was because, if

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing that his
brilliant idea didn't work, he decided to just continue practising
while looking at the two students. The two of them started to
practice together, sparing, performing kicks and punches. It didn't

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was important to
keep this going for now as he needed to curb the addiction away.
Sooner was better than later and then he would be able to get

over the place for him to do anything in secret anyway. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was still a
lot of exp to be obtained before reaching level twenty, the next step
for Quinn in his vampire evolution. It would be difficult now since
there were no more planned expeditions for the year to other portal

defeating beasts for the first time. </FONT></FONT>

his inventory where the intermediate crystal could be seen. It was
just the item he needed to create a short sword from the shop. When

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Walking around on
top of the arena was a bit harder compared to the other day. It was
now fully filled and bustling like a city centre with a sale on the
weekend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A big event
that attracts people from all over,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily the platform
was quite large and wide, allowing plenty of space for the vast
amounts of people to move around. At the moment, most of the people
were gathered around the screens that were stationed ever so often
along the circular path. They were now turned on and were displaying
the starter events for the day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The &quot;block,
block&quot; event that the group wanted to go to was stationed on
screen seven. While walking by, they managed to catch a few events on
the other screens. On one of the screens, there was a soccer match
going on that allowed the use of specific abilities. There were
complicated rules for which abilities were allowed and not allowed
for this event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed quite
hectic and was hard to follow along, but after the introduction of
ability soccer, normal soccer just seemed boring to watch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next screen they
passed there were giant pillars as tall as a house. The students were
told to use their abilities and craft the most beautiful object they
knew of, and there were even more going on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was such a joyous
day, and the atmosphere around them was great. Usually, on a
day-to-day basis, Quinn would have someone throw an insult or a slur
towards him, but everyone was far too focused even to notice him or
the others there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He felt guilty that
he wouldn't be able to enjoy the events that were going on, for he
had Peter on the back of his mind. Even if he knew why they decided
to do this to Peter, he still didn't know what they would do after,
nor could he do anything. He wasn't able to get strong enough in time
and hoped that after using Peter as bait like Logan thought they
would allow Peter to live at school a bit longer before moving him on
to trial. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In that time frame,
Quinn would try to get as strong as possible and save him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, they had
finally reached screen seven, and there was already a large crowd in
this section. In fact, it was the largest crowd compared to all the
other screens. At first, it was mostly filled with just students, but
later on, adults and others from different factions came to take a
look since they too were wondering why the event was so popular. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I didn't know
Block was such a popular game?&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It isn't,&quot;
Vorden replied. &quot;I never expected there to be this many people.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group walked
through some of the people who were at the back, not paying attention
until they eventually found some seats around the middle area. There
were seats for those who wanted to stay and watch the event
permanently in front of every screen. There were then standing areas
towards the back and sides, for those who might want to continue to
walk around and see the other events. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most people
preferred to stand. That way, they could go to the stands or watch
the other events and come back to the ones they enjoyed first, But
because Quinn and the others didn't want to watch anything else, they
were happy just to sit down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry,&quot;
Quinn said as they passed a man that they didn't have any military
uniform on and sat in the three seats next to him. The man was
sitting at the very end of the row. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After sitting down
and watching the event for a while, they realized how boring a game
it was to watch rather than play. The game was currently at level
three, and they needed to witness multiple students to do the same
thing again and again, clearing the same level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't an
exciting atmosphere like last night, and there were even a few in the
crowd starting to yawn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we
might have made the wrong decision to trust you to pick the event,&quot;
Fex said, yawning himself and stretching his arms. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll go get us
some drinks and snacks. You guys can wait here.&quot; Vorden said as
he left his seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,&quot;
The man sitting next to them said as he brushed his long hair that
went down to his collar bone away and placed them behind his ears.
&quot;Although the beginning is a bore, this type of game gets better
in the later rounds.&quot; He said with a smile. When looking at the
man, he had beautiful clear skin and didn't look a lot older than
twenty. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both Fex and Quinn
didn't know what to say, so they just smiled back at the man and
carried on watching the event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What he said was
true, Quinn thought. The later rounds would be far more exciting, and
he would love to see others' perform at a level beyond five. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the levels went
up, more students started to get knocked out. It didn't seem like it
was because they couldn't do it, but instead was due to the event's
nerves and pressure. They had made silly mistakes at crucial times. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The atmosphere was
still tame. However, that all seemed to change when they had
announced they would start to move onto level four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The audience members
seemed to perk up and started chatting heavily among themselves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is there
something big that happens when it reaches level four?&quot; Fex
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not that I can
remember when we played yesterday. It was the same right, even up
till level five. It just got faster, and the attack patterns changed
slightly.&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man sitting next
to them had overheard their conversation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, so you
managed to beat the game at level five. I might say that's quite
impressive, what's your top level?&quot; The man asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know,&quot;
Quinn replied. &quot;We stopped playing after Level five. We were
only playing because of a bet anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden soon returned
with the drinks and snacks, and by now, a few students had already
passed and were knocked out by the level four machine. Then when the
next participant started, he did something that seemed odd. Instead
of blocking the attacks, it looked like he was trying to hit the
machine as soon as it moved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students had
gone wild after seeing this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it him? So
he was at the event after all!&quot; A Student shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But soon after, he
had made a mistake and had hit the machine before it even moved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess he
couldn't be in the tournament, especially if he were in the video. It
happened here on the top floor, remember?&quot; Another said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Fex, with
their hearing, were able to overhear the students talking. When
hearing what they were saying, they looked at each other. Unsure
about what was happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They didn't say a
word but had a dreadful feeling in the back of their minds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game continued
with several other students attempting to do the same thing. They
were hitting the machine as soon as it moved to make it look as if it
was standing still. In the end, not a single student was able to
achieve it, and even the favorite to win the competition was knocked
out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man who was
sitting by their side was finding the whole thing strange. He had
watched the event multiple times in the past years but had never seen
anything like this happen. Nor the level of excitement coming from
the other students nor the strategy the participants were using. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can I ask?&quot;
The man said to the student sitting in front of him. &quot;Why are
they all attempting to attack the machine like that? Why not just
play the game like normal.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You mean you
haven't seen the video?&quot; The student replied back. &quot;My
guess is the contestants saw the same thing we all did. There's a
video of someone playing the game at level four, who was able to
attack the machine before it even moved. He managed to clear the
level perfectly, not making a single mistake while doing this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of
something hitting the floor and then ice spilling all over the place
was heard. When the man turned around, he noticed that the student
sitting by his side had dropped his drink. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What the hell? How
do they know about the video?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The level four event
had ended, and since there were now very few participants, the events
team needed to do something to fill the time. They decided that they
would interview the favorites to win the event. It was quite a shock
since most of the participants had been knocked out earlier than
planned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On-screen, one of
the students was being interviewed who went by the name of Kyle. He
was the favorite to win the event but had attempted to do the strange
actions and was knocked out in the process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Kyle, we just
wanted to ask, what made you change tactics like that? We saw many
here today attempt the same thing you did today, but it seemed like a
risky move that didn't pay off.&quot; The female interview asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This game has
become too easy in the past. I knew that if I played usually, I would
have had a high chance of winning, but what's the point when most
likely the best person in this game isn't even participating. After
seeing someone do what seemed like an impossible task, I decided I
would try to challenge him in my own way. The plan was to emulate
what this person had done in a video I saw today. If I achieved that
at level four, I would try to do the same at level five and send out
a challenge to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It turns out after
attempting and failing at a level four. I respect this student even
more.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The screen then went
back to the interview, who had a few more words to say. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For those of
you unaware, the video Kyle was talking about was uploaded last
night. It had become an overnight sensation due to the timing of
things and how it was filmed and done only a day before this very
event and at this exact place. The video will be played on the screen
now for you all to see.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The screen changed
once again, and now full on the big screen in front of everyone, the
video of Quinn in the gaming booth was then shown. His face was
blurred out, but the others, even though it was their first time

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three boys
continued to watch the video, which was being played on the huge
screen in disbelief. For some reason, that one minute video felt like
a three hour long movie. All Quinn wanted to do now was run up there
and shut it off and erase everyone's memory. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Quinn,
isn't that…&quot; Fex immediately had his hand grabbed over by
Vorden and Quinn, who were standing by his side. The two boys then
quickly dragged Fex out of the seats as they disappeared out of the
crowd. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex, are you
crazy?&quot; Vorden shouted in a soft but angry voice. Knowing that
there could still be others around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video had now
finally stopped playing, and the interviews carried on with other
participants who had attempted the same method. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No one knows
it's Quinn, and you were just about to reveal to everyone it was
him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video blurred
out Quinn's head, making him unrecognizable. The only thing that
could be seen was a blurred person wearing the school uniform.
However, Vorden was concerned about whether someone could deblur the
video, would they be able to see the face or not? Unfortunately,
Vorden wasn't the right person for things like this, and he wished he
could speak to Logan right now and dim his curiosity. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Annoyed that he was
suddenly dragged away, Fex stepped back a bit and brushed away some
of the crumbs of food that had fallen all over him in a rush. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What did you
say, no one knows it was him, right? Well, I wouldn't be so sure
about that one. Because there were five other people with us at the
time, who do know it was him.&quot; Fex said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't think
that's a problem,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;This video seemed to
have already spread, right? If they wanted to, they could have
already told everyone. In a normal case, someone would be happy for
this to happen. Perhaps there are already people coming forward, even
claiming that they were the ones in the video. Zac probably thinks I
will do the same and when I do try to discredit it and ruin my big
moment.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Still, just to
be safe, I think we should go looking for them and try to clear their
memories a bit.&quot; Fex suggested. &quot;Let's split and search for
them. We should have done this yesterday, but I didn't think such a
small thing like this would become a big deal. Damn it! all we did
was play a freaking game.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The boys agreed it
was always better to be safe than sorry, and even if Quinn was right
about his thoughts, there was a chance one could change their mind
later on and this small mistake may bring up huge trouble for them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's best if
we split up, we can cover more ground then and find them faster. Use
the watch to send a message as soon as you see them.&quot; Vorden
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three boys
quickly split and headed off into different sections as they searched
for Zac and the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While this was all
happening, the strange man that was seated next to them couldn't help
but find all of their actions odd. Everything changed as soon as the
video started to play he noticed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Was one of them in
the video?' The man thought. Otherwise, it didn't make sense based on
the actions and what they were currently doing now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What an interesting
bunch of kids.' He thought as he chuckled to himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, another
older looking man approached him from the side. He wore regular plain
clothing that didn't make him stand out much. When gaining access to
the area, the public, including the students who weren't
participating in any events, were told to hand over all of their
beast equipment or leave them behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sir, the main
events will start soon. They instructed me to bring you and the
others to an appropriate place as soon as possible.&quot; The old man
said, bowing down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just when I
thought I found something more fun to do.&quot; The man said as the
two of them walked off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was running
about pretty recklessly; unlike yesterday, there were far too many
people to check to see if they could find them. Other than Zac, many
of them had pretty unmemorable faces as well. The first area Vorden
decided to check where each of the screens nearby. At least then, he
would be able to get someplace high and see from the top if he could
spot anyone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking around,
Vorden was trying to see if there was anywhere high he could get a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Need any

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sam?&quot;
Vorden replied as he turned around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys quickly
started exchanging information, and Vorden explained what was going
on and the reason for the worried look on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually, I
already saw the video as well.&quot; Sam replied, &quot;And you're in
luck, you don't have to worry about those guys, let me explain…&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Early in the day,
Sam had decided to pay a visit to the gaming centre and wanted to
talk to the admin man who had uploaded the video. There was no one
else who had access to that footage, or at least not that part on
that particular day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he had arrived,
Zac and his group were already there trying to get the original video
file from the man. After listening in for a while, it turned out
after the video was a big hit, the group tried to get video proof of
what the person looked like or their name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It turns out they
had already attempted to reveal to the people who the blurred figure
was, but with no name and only the description of curly hair, it was
hard for them to believe. In the video, one couldn't even see if the
person had curly hair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It went a step
further when they mentioned the student had a level 1 ability level
on his wrist watch; they thought this would have been a stand out
feature, instead to others, it just became a big lie that was
unbelievable. In the end, people completely ignored them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After that incident,
they were embarrassed to tell others who they thought it was, so
instead, they wanted to get the original video file. However, the
man-in-charge was determined not to give access to the video to
anyone and even claimed the file had already been deleted and
rewritten over. Now it was impossible to recover. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man only wanted
to share the incredible feat, but didn't want the pressure to be put
on the student. If Quinn himself were to come here and ask for the
original video, he would have given it to him on the spot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With nothing else to
do, the group eventually left the place in disappointment. That's
when Sam noticed the main culprit from yesterday wasn't there, Zac. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
coming towards Sam, so he decided to hide himself and pretend he was
doing something else and tried to listen to their conversation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't

than that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm telling
you man, after yesterday, he just said he doesn't want any business
with that fellow. It's like he was traumatized or something.&quot;
The students said as they walked past him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After learning about
this incident, Vorden's heart started to calm down a little. It was
too much sometimes to keep this many secrets in this small group. His
own was enough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Knowing that
everything was okay, Vorden decided to send a message to both Quinn
and Fex to explain the situation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the same time,
Quinn had received the ping he had just found Zac. Using his hearing
and a keen sense of smell, he was eventually able to locate him from
yesterday. When there were large crowds of people, all he needed to
do was repeatedly use his inspect skill until he found the right
person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Zac's
eyes met up with Quinn's, he gulped. Remembering that strange feeling
when he couldn't control his body. He didn't move or run away and
just followed Quinn off to the side. When the two of them reached the
edge of the arena, Zac constantly looked over at the railing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thoughts ran through
his head of the possibilities this crazy person might have done. He
even assumed that his ability might have been mind control. If he
could control his body and tell him to stand still, maybe he could
also make his death look like a suicide. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I promise I

military school you're from. From others, I heard no one believed
them either, and even they know nothing about you.&quot; Zac said
quickly. </FONT></FONT>

Fex? Did you send out a message to him too?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I did,&quot;
Vorden replied. &quot;I sent one out the same time as I sent one to
you, telling him our location and everything. I wonder why he isn't
here yet.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The first main
event will start in around fifteen minutes.&quot; A speaker sounded
informing all of the students as well as the public to get ready for
the first main event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We'll head
back to the screen near our hotel, just send him another message to
meet us there,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, aren't
you worried about him?&quot; Sam asked. &quot;What if another group
like yesterday approaches him.&quot; Sam was a little concerned after
what had happened yesterday. He wasn't ignorant of the behaviour and
actions treated towards low levels. He seemed to remember yesterday
that not only Quinn but Fex was a level one user as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If another group of
people were to approach him, it could be bad news again without his
friends around. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about him, I can't imagine anyone scaring away that guy,&quot; Quinn
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group, including
Sam, had decided to watch the main event together. Although Sam's
Hotel was quite far away from theirs, he didn't mind the walk back in
the evening. If he were to go back and watch it near his hotel
screen, he wouldn't have anyone to watch it with anyway. At least not
until Nate was knocked out of the competition and he couldn't imagine
that happening on the first day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When arriving at the
screen things looked a little different to when the events were
played earlier on in the day. The screen had moved outward and looked
like they were all hovering in the air above the arena. It allowed
students to look over the edge and either watch the event from up
high in the actual area or see sufficient detail on the screen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Several drones were
flying about in the arena, each with a camera attached. It would be
used to record as much detail of the events as possible. Most
students would decide to watch it via the screen, but it was still
nice to see what the real thing looked like from above. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The boys decided
that they would peek over to see what the first stage of the main
event was like. Everything that was out before had been cleared and
right now there were a total of one hundred and forty small little
raised platforms out. On the platform was a workbench of some sort
with several other items and even a hot furnace behind them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the others had
their eyes glued on the stage, Quinn and both Vorden noticed
something else. Inside the arena, there was one section of seats that
had been cleared out, and in its place was a very large luxurious
booth. There was see-through glass allowing all the others to see
what was inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the booth
were five relatively large grand chairs inside. There were also
already several soldiers standing at each side of the room, still
like a statue. All of them wore the same beast gear that looked to be
of very high quality. It was a standout because not many people in
the arena had such beast gear on as they weren't allowed due to
safety precautions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was natural for
not only Quinn, but for those around to pay attention to the booth,
and he had a pretty good feeling he knew who those seats were
reserved for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then it looked like
the first person had arrived in the special booth. The soldiers in
the room didn't bow down like they usually would when greeting a
guest of high honour. Instead, they immediately went down on one knee
and placed their fist on the ground. As soon as Quinn saw the person,
there was no need for an introduction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There probably
wasn't a single person who didn't know of this man. He continued to
walk past the others, his heavy boots hitting the ground. He looked
through the clear glass and adjusted his red-tinted sunglasses.
Finally, as he sat down in the middle seat of the five, his whole
face could be seen. On his chin was a little patch of facial hair,
and on the top of his head was a full mop of hair that had streaks of
grey going through. It was hard to tell if it was dyed due to the
pattern or whether it was just their old age. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the man was
comfortably sat in his seat, the other soldiers stood up in the room
and saluted. &quot;We welcome the supreme commander.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man sitting in
the seat was the supreme commander Oscar White one of the men hailed
as a hero during the time of the great war. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the war had
started against the Dalki race, the enemy had done something
unexpected. When the Dalki first arrived, it was clear they were
under attack by a form of higher intelligence. They had better
equipment and technology than humans. However, when the humans first
saw the appearance of the Dalki, they looked strange and more like
that of a wild animal mixed with a human. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This caused the
leaders at the time to be hesitant, thinking about whether or not
these were the real enemy or not. In their naivety, they never
expected the Dalki to pull off what they had done. While the main
forces were in battle, at the start of the war the Dalki had chosen
to assassinate each of the top countries leaders around the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was to cause
chaos and confusion amongst the humans, and for a short time, their
plan had really worked. That was until the head of the allied Earth
forces at the time had decided to take charge. The person's name was
Oscar White. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Later on, after the
war, he had given himself the title of supreme commander and then
appointed the seven head generals of the other basis. Of course, not
everyone agreed to this, and there was the disturbance of ability
users running wild. It was later on that the big three families would
be established and further along the line Truedream would be added to
make it the big four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the rose-like
building that was seen whilst on the train, there was something
called the leader's table inside. Whenever a big decision was to be
made, the supreme commander, the seven head generals and the big four
would be called together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the first
person to enter was the supreme commander, it looked like Quinn's
guess of who the other four seats were for was spot on. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Will the
others be arriving?&quot; Oscar asked his personal aide on his right
that stood by his side. It was a female who wore a fairly short skirt
and round glasses with a ponytail. Rather than looking like she
worked for the army, she looked like a security for a big tech
company instead. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she said that,
the doors from behind opened wide and the four others entered after. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first person to
enter was a large man who looked to be in his fifties, with a huge
apple-like belly. His hair was a scruffy mess that went up into a
triangle shape, and his nose was large and round as well. He went on
to sit in one of the empty seats, and as he sat down, he gave a loud
belching burp. As the air left his mouth, a stream of fire came out
with it before quickly disappearing into the air. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next to follow
after him was a female, who seemed to be mostly dressed in black head
to toe, and on the top of her head was a pointy hat. The hat was
covering most of her facial features as there was also a veil
attached. The only thing that could be seen through was her large
smile and her purple dark hair. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not a word was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All five of the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, as you
can see, the five seats are for the big four family members as well

graduated from the military academy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

that the old man was sick for a long amount of time, there were even
rumours that he had already passed away, but for fear of not having a

If my guess is right, they can no longer hide it. The person you're
looking at is the new master.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

was very plausible in Sam's mind. The question was, Sam, who prided
himself in being exceptionally knowledgeable in current world
politics, had heard the same rumours. But it seemed Vorden was
equally familiar, if not a little more. This strange group of people
started to interest him more, and perhaps Quinn wasn't the only

head, we can put on a special exhibition show for everyone to see
right here right now.&quot; The young man said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Burnie, in response,
stomped his foot in anger. As it hit the ground floor, flames shot up
from his feat. It looked like small wings had appeared before quickly
vanishing away into clouds of smoke. &quot;I'll burn you to a crisp
right at this instant!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The soldiers
standing by watching were all frightened of what was to happen. Right
now, it looked as if two of the strongest people on earth were about
to do battle. If they were to try to stop them, they couldn't do a
thing. It was also a big reminder to everyone; these people in the
room were not friends. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it wasn't for the
fact that each of these people had a common enemy, the Dalki. There
would still be a civil war between all five of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please,&quot;
Oscar said. &quot;Today is an event for the future generation, for
the kids to display their skills, not you two. If you wish to fight,
then do it after we get rid of the Dalki.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Oscar then walked
over to the young man; in all honesty, he too didn't like how the
young man was acting. Usually, he had a good read of people's
strength, but it was nearly impossible to tell, which truly
frightened him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry for
assuming you were only a stand-in. It was my mistake to say so. I
will be the first to welcome the new leader of the Graylash family.
Please name.&quot; Oscar asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Owen Graylash,
the new head of the family, the youngest and most powerful head to
ever serve.&quot; When saying the last line, he looked past Oscar and
directly at Burnie. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, he's a
confident leader. I'll give him that.&quot; Mona said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a good
trait to have.&quot; Jack agreed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With everything
having calmed down a little, they each sat adequately in their seats,
and it was time for them to enjoy the event now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The speakers were
turned on, and now all of the screens displayed what was happening in
the centre of the arena. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ladies and
gentlemen, we hope you had a wonderful day so far. There were many
spectacular events, but as usual, we have saved the best till last.
The first round of the three main events will now begin, and to start
it all off, we have the wonderful crafting event.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The camera then went
on to show the materials of what was on each separate section. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you can
see, each participant has been given the same materials. The only
thing that is missing is the beast crystal. Once all participants are
ready, they must try to figure out with their eyes alone what the
best use for the beast crystal would be. Then our wonderful judges
will decide which equipment is best.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of the
participants started to appear from underneath the arena and were now
entering the ground floor. The participants had a number displayed on
their watches, indicating which platform they needed to head off to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, there's
Logan,&quot; Quinn said, still looking over the edge. &quot;Number
33.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, you have a
friend in this event then, I guess I'll keep an eye on him.&quot;
Just then, Sam tried to squint over the edge where Quinn was looking,
but they were too far up to be able to see anything. It just looked
like a bunch of ants were down below. Without looking at the screen,
there was no way he would be able to see what number any of the
participants were wearing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You have some
good eyesight,&quot; Sam said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh...Thanks.&quot;
Quinn replied nervously, to which Vorden gently stepped on his foot.
It was a reminder to be careful since they were no longer alone.
That's when he realized Fex still hadn't arrived and decided to send
another message just in case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, let the
tournament begin!&quot; The announcer said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately, the
student started to work away; the first step was to inspect the
crystal. Crystals were quite versatile and could create several
different weapons and armour, but certain patterns and shapes seen
within the crystal could help decide what one would be best to be
turned into. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An example, a
crystal from a turtle-like beast would usually best be used to make
defensive equipment, perhaps even a shield. It could be turned into a
weapon but wouldn't be very useful. If one didn't know what beast it
had come from, they would only be able to tell by inspecting the
crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once this step was
complete, the crystal would need to be melted down to the appropriate
temperature, depending on what was to be made. The next step after
was deciding the mould and finally mixing the melted beast core with
the required metals. Cheap or expensive metals could be used but
would affect the quality of the end result. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The rest was down to
the forger. Depending on the forger's level, the quality and strength
of the weapon or armour would be decided. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most of the students
had already finished inspecting the crystal and had moved on to the
melting process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The camera continued
to pan around to the many students working away hard; however, the
camera eventually reached one student. A short little one who seemed
to be just standing there with his eyes closed. It looked as if he
was sleeping in the middle of the tournament. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is Logan
doing?&quot; Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like
he's asleep if you ask me?&quot; A voice said from behind. As the
boys turned their heads, they could see Fex standing there. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quite some time had
passed since Vorden had sent out his first message. No matter where
Fex was, it shouldn't have taken him as long as it did for him to
arrive. It wasn't as if the boys were joined by the hip, and they
couldn't do anything themselves. But it was more like there was
nothing else to do. The event was the only thing happening right now.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Other than Quinn and
them, Fex didn't get along with anyone else being a level one. So he
had no one else to watch the show with either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey come on,
did you miss me that much?&quot; Fex said, looking at Vorden who had
a strange look on his face. He was still wondering about what could
have taken him so long. &quot;Look, don't worry I just had something
that really upset my stomach yesterday and was in the toilet, trust
me you don't want to go into the boy's toilet by screen four, I think
you can still smell it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden looked at him
even stranger now, and even Quinn was starting to feel slightly
awkward, and it wasn't the bad jokes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did vampires even
get stomach aches?' Vorden thought. 'By bad meal is he talking about
blood.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So I heard
that you guys dealt with the Zac problem all okay huh, why don't you
tell me about that. What happened with that.&quot; Fex words when
spoken were quick and to the point. he wasn't even giving enough time
for the others to reply to what he had already said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was acting
really strange. He usually joked about a lot and often, but it felt
as if he was trying to force himself this time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn noticed this
and a few other strange things straight away. As soon as Fex arrived,
he was sweating; Vampires often didn't even sweat from strenuous
activity as they had high amounts of stamina. This was different;
this type of sweat was from something else, as if he was scared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other thing that
made Quinn think this was his heartbeat. The stronger a vampire was
usually, the less their bodily organs needed to be used. Their
heartbeats were able to be slowed, and the amount of blood and oxygen
that needed to be carried around their body was lessened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So the fact that
Quinn could hear that Fex had a fast heartbeat he knew something was
up. He wasn't in control of his emotions right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Damn it they know,
calm down will you.' Fex said to himself in anger. Seeing that the
others weren't buying his act. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, you said
you're friends number 33, right?&quot; Sam called over, &quot;Well,
it looks like he isn't doing too well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Their attention was
focused on Fex this whole time that they had forgotten about the
competition. When looking at the screen, the camera was once again
focused on Logan, and still, he hadn't touched anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, it looks
like he doesn't care about the event then,&quot; Said Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're
probably right,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, Sam
was quite shocked. How could someone waste an opportunity like this
on such a grand stage? Not only were the big four watching, but so
were many factions from all over. A forger was highly sorted after so
even if the one displayed a little bit of skill, they could quickly
join a faction and live the rest of their lives peacefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two decided to
question Fex later; acting strange wasn't a call of emergency, it
couldn't have been something urgent. Otherwise, Fex would have
informed them immediately. They both trusted him now after the many
times he had helped them out before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The timer continued
to go down for the event until, eventually, the buzzer had sounded
singling the end of the competition. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using his advanced
eyesight, Quinn quickly looked down at all the items that had been
made and used his inspect skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It allowed him to
see each item's stats clearly displayed out, as a screen hovered
above each one, at first Quinn was doing this individually looking at
an item but then suddenly, a familiar sound was heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Inspect skill has
risen to Level 3] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The number of times
he had used the skill while looking for Zac and now during the
contest had helped greatly and finally, it had risen to level three. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Know when looking at
the items, all of them immediately had a screen displaying their
stats. There was no longer any need to use the inspect skill on each
item individually. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, he
could see the level of equipment made significantly varied. It seemed
like they were only given a basic crystal to make an item. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some had chosen to
make ranged weapons out of the crystal, some chose regular melee
weapons, and a few decided on armour. It just went on to prove how
difficult a forgers job was. The fact that not everyone had made the
same item meant it wasn't; easy to decide what the crystal would be
best used for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, when Quinn
looked using his inspect skill, he could quite clearly see. The
ranged weapons and armour had an extra description, saying whatever
stat the current weapon was at would be halved. Some of the poorer
made equipment only allowed an increase of one strength. With the 50
per cent stat decrease, it practically meant the weapon was only a
little better than using one's own fist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The melee weapon was
the right choice giving the user an extra two strength when being
used. The perfect melee weapon that could be made from the item was a
long sword. Whoever had made a long sword out of the items, it would
give an additional three strength. There were very few longswords
that had been made with the crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then finally, there
was a difference in the quality and skill of the forger. The ones
that had made a longsword, each one of them looked quite different
from another. Some just had a basic plus-three in strength, and there
was one with a plus-four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But in Quinn's eyes,
there was a clear winner out of them all. For one of the students
managed to make a sword with a plus-three to the strength stat, but
also it had an added weapon skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first student
was the one that had created the long sword with the added weapon

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Logan, we just
wanted to ask you a question. You were the only student to not make
anything out of the materials presented today is there any reason for
that?&quot; The female asked as she shoved a microphone directly to
his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I am not a
forger but an inventor. I find making weapons quite tedious and
boring, to be honest with you. I felt because I don't respect the art
of forging like others this was not my stage.&quot; Logan replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From the side, a few
of the forgers started to chuckle. &quot;Yeah right, what a good
excuse, more like he doesn't know how to forge a weapon. He would
just have been embarrassed with whatever he had made.&quot; The
student had said this quite loudly on purpose trying to embarrass
Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then grabbed
the mike closer to himself and faced the student. &quot;I assure you,
creating something that would best that would best the weapon in your
hand would only take a few minutes.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The interview had a
huge smile on her face. She loved drama and entertainment, and it was
moments like this the crowd loved as well. &quot;Very well, would you
like to redeem yourself, Logan, why don't we allow you to create a
weapon now and a judge can come over and decide?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, Logan
wouldn't have done something that placed him in the limelight so
much. However, he hated it when others said that he couldn't do
something when he could. It was as if they were calling him a liar. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan walked back up
to his section in the arena; all of the equipment was still untouched
from before. The event organizers allowed this as usually there was
quite a bit of set up time before events and they would delay it with
useless speeches or question and answer segments. This was far better
than any of those. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The forgers were
allowed to use their abilities, many of them had abilities that would
help in the forging process, and Logan was no exception. The little
spiders that covered his costume in a small suit started to break
down and reform. They gathered on his back and then started to sprout
out three individual arms on each side. When they finally finished
forming, it looked like Logan himself was a giant spider. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The crafting speed
alone was enough to have the other impressed. They didn't even really
care about the quality of the weapon. Still, the judges standing by
the side could already tell while watching Logan make the weapon that
it was one of decent quality. It wasn't the best weapon to be made
today, but for the amount of time it had taken it was better then
they had expected. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The interview
grabbed the long sword created by Logan, and the one made by the

struck them both against each other as hard as she could. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she lifted the
sword made by the heckler, the camera zoomed closely on the sword.
and there was a reasonably large chip that went in around halfway
into the side of the sword. When they turned to look at the one Logan
had made, there was but only a small scratch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The crowd cheered in
excitement, as they saw this. They loved someone who could back up
his word. They were far too used to braggers who could never achieve
what they said, and it seems like Logan was not one of them. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His sister was known
for upholding the vampire laws no matter what. She was strict and
always completed the tasks given to her. The complete opposite of

Silver. She was far too powerful and would have never let him stay. </FONT></FONT>

to start, and the screen displayed the field where it would take
part. Compared to before, it looked like the arena was completely
transformed. On the screen now, there was what looked like a little
makeshift town. The town looked to be partly destroyed and looked
more like ruins. But there were several areas that would allow
students to use them as vantage points. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The participants of
the event entered the stage once more. All the ranged users entered
with their beast weapons by their side, while also wearing a strange
red colored chest piece that seemed to cover their entire upper body.

the participants closely, not a single one of them wore any beast
armour or boots. The only different thing was the weapons themselves.

arrows, and the same for the other weapons as well. </FONT></FONT>

attack each other and must enter the small makeshift town. </FONT></FONT>

touches the red marking on the participants' chest a sound will
indicate, showing they have been eliminated from the round. Students
must quickly exit the field and the red coloured chest piece will
turn black showing they are no longer active. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
randomly split into four groups for this event. Each of them was to
enter the small makeshift town from the north, south, east, and west
entrances. The layout of the town was like a plus sign. There were
several buildings and small alleyways, but larger pathways crossed
each other in the centre. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla was at the

that she recognized with her as well. The annoying blonde hair girl
along with the brother and sister pair. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She took in several
deep breaths, for some reason, the nerves were getting the better of
her. Usually, she was quite good at calming herself down in these
types of situations. Her mother would always tell her that one would
only get nervous if they actually cared about what they were about to
do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Does that mean

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I just have to get
through the first round. If I can do that, it will prove I could
actually do something on my own and I'm not just some burden on
everyone.&quot; Layla said to herself, 'Just don't get eliminated,
just don't get eliminated, you can do it, Layla.' She carried on
repeating these words to herself as if it was some chant. The more
she said, the less likely it seemed to become a reality. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although she was
going against Pure's wishes, they hadn't even bothered to explain to
her what they had planned to do, which had irritated Layla quite a
bit. Going against their orders, she would at least have liked to
pass the first round to prove to herself she could do it and then she
would immediately eliminate herself from the second round with no
problem. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One more day inn the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, and
let the event begin!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The buzzer had
sounded signalling the start of the event, and students from all four
entrances had entered the small town. Above the arena, a holographic
display of the countdown had begun. Some students had split off
immediately from the group and went on to look for their hiding
spots, while others already had a few targets in their minds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And Layla had a
sneaking suspicion she had become one of those targets. Right on her
back, out of the corner of her eye, She could see the blonde girl and
brother and sister pair. Although this was a singles' tournament, it
looked like they knew each other beforehand and had decided to team
up. While looking around, Layla noticed that this was a tactic that
had already been implemented by many. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A lot of people were
running together in groups rather than singles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did they decide
this beforehand or just now?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was too risky for
Layla, and she knew no one else in the competition; all her friends
were on the outside and if she teamed up with people now how would
she know if she could trust them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hoping her
suspicions were not right. Layla decided to stop going along the
straight path and bolted in between two buildings down an alleyway.
However, just like she had expected, the other three had followed
her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why, why did
you have to target me? What did I do? Is it cause I look weak?&quot;
She said in anger as she gripped her bow. There were now only fifteen
seconds left on the timer before participants were allowed to hit
each other and eliminate them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's not
fair!&quot; Quinn shouted at the screen. Seeing that Layla had three
people on her tail. &quot;Why are they grouping up on her?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, you
should know better than anyone that this world isn't fair, not the
way it is right now anyway. It's not against the rules, so let's hope
she doesn't take this loss hard.&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Loss, you
can't count her out just yet,&quot; Fex said positively. &quot;She
can still turn this around.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, both Quinn
and Vorden knew the reality, it was three against one, and they were
all also higher ability users. The only chance she had was to try to
run into another group of people and hope the two of them fought it
out. Allowing one group to eliminate the other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Layla wasn't
even thinking about this tactic. She never thought of trying to use
another group to get rid of the one on her trail. She was too focused
on trying to figure out how to get rid of them all by herself. If she
didn't, she would have felt even more useless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She finally decided
to enter a small building and headed straight for the stairs. At
least this way, she could face them down the stairway one by one as
it was quite narrow. When she reached the top, she turned around the
corner and waited. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of the
buzzer had gone off, indicating once again that the students were now
allowed to attack. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, I
need to survive the first round, at least, and even if I don't, I'm
taking one of you with me.&quot; She gently peeked around the corner,
but there was no sound, not even footsteps could be heard or
shuffling of any kind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Have they
given up?&quot; She thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just to make sure,
she fired an arrow and twisted it around the corner with her ability,
hoping to hit anyone on the other end of the staircase. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A little bell sound
was heard, indicating that a player had been hit. A broad smile
appeared on her face. When attempting to move she looked down at
herself and noticed that her red chest piece had turned black. She
was the one who had been hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hello?&quot; A
high pitched voice from the right side said, sounding a little
distant. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When she looked
outside, it seemed like the voice was coming from a glassless window
on the other side of the room. She was on the second floor, and if
one were to climb up from the side, they would have either made
plenty of noise or exposed themselves to the many other students. Yet
she had heard nothing. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Popping her head
outside of the window, she could see the blonde-haired girl being
lifted by her other to colleagues with wings on their back. They were
flapping backwards and forth, allowing them to pick up the girl to
reach the window. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As much as she
wanted to shout out in anger at the girl, she couldn't. Layla had
lost fair, and she hadn't even put up much of a fight. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on,&quot;
Quinn said. &quot;There's no need to watch this anymore, let's head
back to the hotel, and we can try to cheer her up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had hoped that
Layla truly didn't care about the event; however, he felt like even
if one didn't care, it would be pretty embarrassing to be the first
one to be eliminated. In the past, she had helped him many times

would have been like. He wanted to be there for her right now. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being eliminated
from the event, Layla left the field and was allowed to head back to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She took the
elevator that went directly to the top of the arena, it was a little
walk from where she was, since the underground facilty looped around
and had sevearal placed along the way. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The elevator from

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ride up the
elevator felt like it was taking forever to reach the top. When she
had lost, she didn't know what emotion to feel. She had tried so
hard, and the only thing she wanted to do was get past the first

eliminated, it hit her even harder. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When her eyes met
with Cia's for a brief second, Layla was quite pleased to see someone
was waiting for her. When Erin had disappeared and left them. It felt
like she had no one to lean on, no one to confide in. Erin had been
the strong figure that Layla wished she could be, and yet it was
something she would never be able to achieve. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, when she
disappeared Layla was a little lost, she had Quinn, but after finding
out she was with Pure there bond was a little broken. There was also
the fact that Vorden would constantly get in between the two and kept
trying to fraction that relationship. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the middle of all
these events that surrounded her, there was a little ray of hope and
that was Cia. After the last portal expedition, she had seen a scared
little side to Cia during that time. She seemed afraid of Quinn and
the others and was confiding in her due to that. Layla, when seeing
this, was seeing a version of herself when she looked at Erin. In a
way, it made her believe she needed to become a stronger figure to
know that someone was relying on her instead of the other way round. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time, she would
be a pillar of support for Cia. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was until the
words spoken out of her mouth were like a thousand knives had been
stabbed right in her back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a straight
look on the young woman's face, her tone was serious, &quot;I've been
waiting for you agent 100,&quot; Cia greeted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was now not a
doubt in her mind, there were only two groups of people that knew her
identity, Pure and Quinn's group. However, what Quinn's group didn't
know was her agent number, and her ranking had recently just dropped
as well. The fact that Cia knew this confirmed that she was part of
Pure herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know you
might be shocked, but it was all because of agent five,&quot; Cia
explained. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Agent five, this
meant Cia being close to her was all of her mother's doing. Suddenly
a realisation was coming into her head. From the very beginning,
since she had entered the academy, Cia had been her roommate. They
had specifically told Layla that she was the only agent that was sent
to military base two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Was everything a
lie?' Now she didn't know what to believe. Was hee new friendship Cia
fake? Was her acting scared was nothing but an act? What was worse
was how much did she already know and how much were they reporting
back to Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her own mother
hadn't trusted her to even complete a mission like this, that they
had to send backup to look after her. When there was a bond of trust,
it went two ways, but her whole life it had always been one-sided.
She trusted her mother with the Pure's true intentions even though
she had so many questions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Yet, she didn't
trust Layla. After everything that had happened so far, something had
snapped inside of Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla walked right
past Cia, ignoring her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, what are
you doing agent 100?&quot; Cia asked, a little shocked by Layla's
actions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't call me
that I'm not a number!&quot; She shouted back. &quot;I have a name
and I have a pretty good one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment, the
automatic doors to the hotel Lobby opened and in walked in, Quinn and
the other boys. They immediately could see her bloodshot red eyes,
but had mistaken them for sadness instead of anger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you okay
Layla what's wrong?&quot; Quinn said as he rushed over, placing his
hand on her forehead, checking if she was all okay. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Idiot. Why
didn't you come sooner.&quot; She said. &quot;And your hands cold.&quot;
At this moment, the full waterworks had come out, as tears of
waterfall started to fall and her head was now laying deep into
Quinn's chest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hug her dude,&quot;
Fex whispered in his ear. While the other two boys pretend to look
away and whistle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not knowing what to
do in this type of situation, he listened to Fex's advice and gave a
strong and firm hug to Layla as he tried to calm her down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn!&quot;
She cried. &quot;I don't want to be useless anymore…. I don't.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla, when
have I ever said you were useless?&quot; Quinn replied, at this
point, Vorden had decided to step away, knowing full well he had said
that a few times. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You have done
nothing but helped me from day one.&quot; He replied back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the scene,
Cia didn't know what to do. She had still not even finished
explaining the details of the upcoming plan. Agent five had assigned
her the task to look over agent 100. No matter what was to happen,
this was her only mission. But right now, she couldn't interrupt this
scene. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla..&quot;
She tried calling out. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go away! Go
Away!&quot; She screamed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, the
others noticed that Cia was standing behind her. And seeing this
strange reaction, Vorden started to wonder. He found it strange that
Layla had broken down like this over the event. Sure she would be
upset but was it really such a big deal? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, she
clearly doesn't like you being here. So just scram.&quot; Vorden
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can do what
the hell I want.&quot; Cia snapped back. &quot;You're not my boss,
and you're not a teacher.&quot; She said as she continued to walk
forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just remember,
I know about your secret, and yours.&quot; She said as she pointed at
both Fex and Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam, who was
currently a bystander at this point, didn't have a clue what was
happening and was finding it hard to follow along. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'It's like I've been
transported in the middle of a soap opera while still in the middle
of the season.&quot; He thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia continued to
walk forward, not caring about anything, however after a few steps,
she suddenly could no longer move. Something seemed to be restricting
her movements completely. Then a breath was felt behind her neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would like
to see you just try to tell anyone about that,&quot; Vorden said, in
a sinister voice, it was the first time she had heard him speak like
that. When trying to look down, she could see his hand pressed
against her throat, with nothing but a chopstick pointed at it.
Perhaps others would have laughed, but the deadly aura coming off
from his words, she knew it was no laughing matter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, when looking
ahead, she could see another person, who had his hand held out
steady, with all his fingers pointed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now why would
you chose to threaten us?&quot; Fex said. When hearing the words she
spoke. He felt like this was the worst time for anything to be
revealed. If the humans had found out what he had transported into.
Not even his sister, Silver would be able to save him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's why the
instant she had moved forward and made the threat he had, activated
his strings to hold her in place, at the same time he immediately saw
Vorden and the move, and carefully made sure to allow the strings to
not restrict any of his movements. However, Fex soon realised he
didn't need to do much, as it seemed like Vorden was able to see and
move away from the strings via his own accord. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, Layla
had nearly stopped crying, Quinn still had her held in her hands, She
pushed away slightly from his chest and looked up into his eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, please
I don't want to go back to them,&quot; Layla said. &quot;I want you
to turn me. I want to stay with you. I want to be stronger.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To Sam, it looked
like Layla had just made some type of confession. Although it sounded
weird based on everything that happened, it was the only thing he
could think off. But Quinn very well knew what she meant. She wanted
him to turn her like he did with Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was very
hesitant, especially after what had taken place with Peter so far.
But what happened with him didn't mean the same would happen with
everyone. After all his own life had changed quite a bit, and Layla
was in a troubling situation. He had already figured when she had
said, She didn't want to go back to them. That being with them was
preferable than to Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Changing her, meant
she would be leaving Pure and going to his side. Leaving a big
organisation like that wasn't simple. One would need the power to
fight back, and Layla didn't have that. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn placed both of
his hands on top of Layla's shoulders and moved her off slightly to
the side. Hearing Quinn agree to turn had made her overjoyed and the
sad emotion that filled her was starting to disappear; perhaps this
was the big change she needed in her life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you.&quot;
She said as she sniffled a little bit and rubbed away the last few
tears. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, right now
wasn't the time to change Layla and go through the blood ritual, even
she knew that. They were in the middle of the event, and there was
always the chance the same thing that happened to Peter, could happen
to her. It was best to wait until they were back at school where
Logan could access the black market in case she did turn into a
ghoul. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ladies and
Gentlemen, the fighting event will soon begin!&quot; The speakers
announced. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of the
crowd outside beginning to move was heard. The crowd cheered louder
than before and it could even be heard from the back of the hotel
Lobby where the group were at. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This announcement
and reaction made it clear it was the most anticipated event even out
of the main three. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nate!&quot;
Sam said in a rush, &quot;Sorry guys, I really gotta go watch my
friend. It looks like you guys got things handled here anyway.&quot;
Although many things were happening in front of him, he hardly knew
this group of people and was just helping them out for the time
being. What he wanted to do now more than ever, was go and support
his true friend, Nate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll come with
you,&quot; Logan said, as he was equally concerned at what might
happen to Peter, and one of them from Quinn's group needed to inform
them of what was happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others didn't
have to worry about too much with Sam, it just looked like some type
of strange invitation, and nothing was ever mentioned about Quinn
being a vampire or any sort. All that was revealed was, Quinn and Fex
had some type of secret. Seeing the level one on their wristwatch and
how confident they were, he probably guessed it was something to do
with the fact that they hid their abilities, yet were in the school
on the basis of being weak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, this was
something he could report to the school if he wanted to, but he saw
no reason to. Not being in the same military school, he would have no
benefit from doing such a thing whatsoever, not that he would have
even bothered in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys quickly
left together and went ahead to the screen two area, while the other
three were left behind. However, after hearing the announcement, Fex
was equally worried and wanted to leave as soon as possible. There
was a good chance his sister would be watching the fight. Depending
on how close she was to the arena, she would smell out Peter. Or
there was even the chance of Peter revealing some of his powers
giving him away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was he
was the one holding Cia right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You two can go
as well,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;I can deal with her on my own.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both Vorden and Fex
looked at each other from the other sides. It was the first time
Quinn was requesting something like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He would often ask
for their advice in situations like this, so they found it a little
strange, did he already have a plan? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;
Vorden asked, still keeping the chopstick he had in his hand close to
Cia's throat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sure.&quot;
Quinn said, &quot;Honestly, I haven't given up on Peter yet. I need
you two to see if there's any way of saving him, any gaps in their
routine if we can ship him off. I know it's unlikely, and even if we
can't. At least find out what they plan to do to him, so we can get
revenge later on.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the first
time they had heard Quinn declare that he had planned to go against
the military in the open like this. Saving one's friend from them was
different. He was now clearly saying if he couldn't save them at one
point, he would punish those that did this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I like it,&quot;
Vorden said with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I agree,&quot;
Fex said as he let the strings loosen and return to him. Vorden
quickly ran over, and the other two had left the hotel lobby as well.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn quickly looked
at Layla and just gave a slight nod, indicating her to go off and
follow the boys, before leaving she whispered something into Quinn's
ear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia started to look
around the room to see if there was any way out. The hotel lobby was
quite large, and the area they were in was near the elevators around
the corner from the reception. It was a good twenty meters before
they could be in sight of anyone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She then looked up
at the top right-hand corner, where a camera was present, but she
also knew that was useless as well. There was a specific reason why
Cia had chosen to meet Layla here. The camera here has been disabled
already, in the security room, it would just show a loop, and also it
was far enough from the reception area where no one could hear or see
them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no choice and
the others gone, she felt she could only do one thing. A spirit spear
formed in her hand, and she quickly threw it out towards Quinn.
Straight after, she tried bolting it towards him, as she wished to
run past him and head for the exit or at least the reception area. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Moving to the side
avoiding the first spear, Quinn then went ahead to Cia. Another spear
was thrown, and this one had hit him directly in the stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes!&quot; She
said, knowing full well that Quinn would have been slowed down, but
it was useless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wasn't even
using his full speed; half a second later, he was already directly in
front of her, and he quickly threw out his hand, grasping his fingers
tightly around her neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even with the debuff
he now had far surpassed any regular human's speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she looked into
Quinn's eyes, she could see for some reason, there was great anger.
When the other two had left, she thought the most troublesome ones
had gone. Instead, it looked like the worst one was left behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He knew from the
conversation earlier, that she was Pure, and before Layla had left,
she had told him not to worry about the cameras. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is Pure
planning to do?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As if…I
will..tell you.&quot; She croaked out again. Why was it that she
seemed to be getting strangled all the time by these psychos? she
thought. However, what she was also surprised at was the fact that
Quinn knew about Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did Layla tell them
everything, how much do they know, when she asked for him to turn
her, what did she mean by that? To stay with Quinn does this mean
she's chosen to betray us. I must inform agent Five immediately.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She started to
stretch out her fingers to reach into her back pocket. Inside was a
communication device; maybe she wouldn't be able to talk out in the
open, but if she were just able to turn it on, they would know
something was up. No reply was a sign that an agent would be in
trouble. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's eyes started
to glow even redder now, as he had activated the influence skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You better
hope this works this time. Otherwise, I have no choice but to get rid
of you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia looked into
Quinn's deep red eyes, and her body was frozen in place; she didn't
know why. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Please work….'
Quinn said. &quot;I don't want to kill again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Again?' Cia heard
now fearing for her life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The four others had
just arrived at screen two. They went ahead and sat down in the seats
ready to watch the fighting event. It seemed like there was quite a
bit of preparation work to be done, so thankfully, the fights hadn't
started yet, and they were busy explaining the rules to the audience.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now when looking out
on the field, ten slightly raised circular cylinders went up from the
floor to as high as the first row of audience members. Keeping them
eye level, who were watching from their seats. This allowed for
nearly the perfect view for those sitting there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The flat top surface
of the cylinder would be the fighting platform for the participants.
There were a few ways to lose in the fighting tournament. Your
opponent would be knocked off the cylinder platform. One was to be
knocked out, or the referee who would also be on the cylinder with
them declared one of the students a winner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking out on
all the cylinders, Fex could see his dear sister on one of the
platforms. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Underneath the
arena, the contestants were all busy getting ready for the fighting
event. The weapons and armour they had hidden until now were all out
on full display. Even if one was to see what their opponent was
wearing, there was too little time to try to come up with a
countermeasure. On top of this, the participants themselves did not
know who they were going to go up against. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Students for this
event were also able to use whatever equipment they owned. It didn't
matter whether one person had higher gear than the other. It was all
about individual strength rather than skill. The focus was to show
how they would compete out in the real world. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Above, there were
ten platforms, allowing for there to be ten fights happening
simultaneously at the same time. The fighting event was one of the
most important and most significant events so they needed not to have
too much going on at the same time. Their goal was to allow the
students to display their powers and if all the students were to
fight at the same time, it would be impossible to keep track of them
all. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many factions and
important members were watching this event, looking for their next
recruits. Before going onto the stage, each of their stage names

something to remember the students by. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate continued to
look around and eventually spotted Larry. &quot;Looks like we won't
be facing each other in the first round. That's good. Let me see how
much you have improved before I fight you myself.&quot; He said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't set in
stone, but Nate was pretty sure that the groups had indicated who
would be going out together. And those in the same group would be
facing each other. When he looked over to the group to his right, he
could see not only Larry but also the student who had the two guards
who had never left his side once, standing at the back. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess it's
worth keeping an eye out on you as well,&quot; Nate said, still
curious why they never left his side. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have
something important to tell you.&quot; The guard whispered into
Peter's ear. &quot;Don't even think about surrendering or giving up
the fight. If you do, you will be paying a visit straight back to the
dungeon, and trust me; I can guarantee you don't want to go back
there this time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What he was far more
concerned about was what they were planning to do. Were they really
going to just let him have a fair fight with one of the students
here? It was clear now after spending a whole day with the guards.
With Quinn and the others' strength, there was no way for them to
save him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright,
everyone, Group A, please start to make your way to the platform.&quot;
A soldier ordered, and the first group, which had both, Peter and
Larry, started to make their way up to the stage. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate started to rub
his hands together in excitement; he couldn't wait to see what would
happen. Inside the underground arena, they also had several screens,
which allowed them to see what was going on above. He would have to
observe from there. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The anticipation of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had all entered
the field as the crowd heavily cheered for them. The noise was so
loud it felt like the whole arena was vibrating slightly. Not
everyone was here for recruitment, and it was clear some were here
just to enjoy the show that would be put on. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Rather than
worry about what they are thinking, I'm far more concerned with what
Peter is thinking. He is a little unpredictable when it comes to
situations like these,&quot; Logan replied back. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Fex was now
sweating heavily. He crossed his arms and nervously tapped his foot
away, staring at the screen. He was far more concerned about a bigger
problem. Not being able to take it anymore, he had left his seat and
walked over to the edge to look down at the arena. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, no!...&quot;
Fex thought. The second he looked at his sister, he could tell from
the expression on her face. She had discovered Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Peter had
entered the arena and started to walk over to the platforms, in an
instant, she could smell that there was someone different among them.

where the smell was coming from. </FONT></FONT>

others, not only that... It's a subclass. Don't tell me..' A worrying
thought started to go through her head. It was clear that the
subclass vampire was illegal. She would have been informed before
coming otherwise. There were no doubts about it; the problem was who
had created it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Was it her brother?
If so, there might no longer be any way for her to save him anymore.
After breaking so many rules, he would not get off with a light
punishment. Unable to do anything in the middle of the tournament,
for now, all she could do was keep an eye on the illegal, while
continuing to judge her own fight, since it looked like she wouldn't
be judging the battle with the illegal. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Underneath the
large, stone cylinders, two students stood either side. The pillars
were spread evenly throughout the arena allowing the audience to see

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the crowd, every

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The soldiers were
there in case of an attack from Pure. In fact, there were even more
soldiers than the audience knew off. For several members of the crowd

had in question, they were also unclear how much effort they would
make to rescue him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was also the
possibility that they weren't even going to rescue him at all. The

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, there was
one thing they were sure about, and that was the fact that they would
be watching. Jack, sitting in his booth, was excited. He didn't
really expect anyone from Pure to come. That's why he wanted to put
Peter up for the fight in the first place. So they could brutally see
one of their own being beaten to death. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By each of the

catch anyone who would fall off the stage. As the first stage names

platform. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter's name was
revealed to the audience, there seemed to be a strange reaction
between a few people, and others started to notice this shift. The VR
game that Peter played Power fighters was very popular, and the user
ZombieP had become a hot topic amongst players. However, there were a
few important things to note. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not everyone who
played the game visited the forums; only those that truly enjoyed the
game like Nate and Sam were a part of this group. Second of all, the
servers that Peter played on were the military servers, meaning the
only people who knew about Peter were the military students
themselves. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, the strange

would ask what was so interesting. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
busy sharing information and videos of ZombieP's performance in the
game, and soon nearly every student now knew about ZombieP. However,
those who were in Del's class were confused as the video clearly
showed the person in the video had a regenerative ability, while the
Peter they knew was an earth user. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Peter's
information was being spread between the students, the same couldn't
be said for the people in the arena. They had come from outside of
the military, and even though the game was popular on the outside,
they didn't have access to the military servers and knew nothing of
the name. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the same

found out. The others had told him, they were mainly watching the
fighting tournament because of Peter but didn't explain much else.

fact that everyone was talking about Peter came as a surprise even to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess I
should explain this one since it's partly my fault,&quot; Logan said.
&quot;One day, when I was busy doing my usual tinkering away at my
workbench, Peter had decided to play the game. unbeknownst to me, he
was causing quite a stir in the online world and had become infamous
because of his powerful regenerative abilities.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan was unable to
go into further detail due to Sam being there, but there was quite a
difference between Peter's ability in the game and the one out there.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game had managed
to copy Peter's unique body structure. Rather than ability, it
determined his body was what was causing the extraordinary healing.
This was why it allowed him to use his abilities in the game the same
way Quinn could use his as well. But just how Quinn was able to use
his blood abilities with no drawback, Peter could use his
regenerative abilities as well, making him nearly invincible in the
game. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In real life, this
wasn't the case. Peter did have extraordinary healing abilities, but
if he was pushed to the edge, he would no longer heal until he was

full of water. A strong stream of water came out from the palm of her

his gauntlets and full beast gear on. Everything seemed to be at the

seemed to be ending faster than expected as the participants
continued to be announced as winners. This was half expected form the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'So this is your
grand plan, a setup?' Peter thought. The tournament had to be rigged
from the beginning. The judge not replying was an indicator he was
working for Jack, and his job was to make it so Peter was unable to
surrender or forfeit no matter what. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was now hard for
Peter to tell who was working for Jack and who wasn't. If he was able
to set it up so, all of these things fell in place. There was a good

catch him, were in on the whole plan as well. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'There is another

suspicions were correct and the man below also worked for Jack, there
was no way the man would try to catch him. From this height, his
leg's would shatter and would have to be regenerated on the spot.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he could, Peter
would have liked to win this fight without showing his regeneration

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Making sure not to
stay too close to the edge, Peter decided to also come forward. Larry
had beast gear on that was also enhancing his speed, while Peter wore
nothing. Still, he managed to match his speed, and the two of them
met dead straight in the centre. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A fist was thrown,
and Peter moved his head out of the way, avoiding it by a few inches
as the strike went past his face. The attack was powerful, and the
air around it had caused his hair to move. From Larry's other hand a
wide swing was thrown, this time Peter responded by duking underneath
it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're friends
good at dodging at least,&quot; Sam said, from his experience all
though those blows looked wild, they still came out at a good speed
and with full commitment. It was clear with the first few punches
that Larry was not the Blood Evolver. There was no finesse in the
punches, just raw power. Still, if the blows connected, it was also
clear they would do quite a bit of damage. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex continued to
watch the fight nervously. If he was right in guessing that Peter was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After dodging a few
more punches, Peter was still wondering just when Larry was going to
use his ability. He didn't want to make the first move until he had
uncovered this secret. Another two swings from the side came one
after another, but then suddenly, Peter felt something grab him
around the waist, and then something else held him tightly around the
legs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking down,
he could see what had latched onto him. A set of arms had grabbed him
by the legs, and another set by his biceps, while the other two were
where they should have been in the usual place. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, all the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others in the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking down at the
arms, Peter remained calm as usual. He no longer feared death, maybe
this was because he was already dead. He then started to look at the
arms closely and started to count. &quot;1..2..3.4..5..6.&quot;
Suddenly, Peter began to chuckle to himself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's so
funny?&quot; Larry said annoyed, and also a little concerned when he
felt like he had his opponent trapped. Most of the beast gear that he
had on, had a unique trait to enhance one's strength. This was
perfect for Larry, with his ability to grow extra limbs it meant he
had more power than an average person in each of his arms. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a moment, Larry
stood there still, and soon he began to realise his mistake. His
cheeks started to turn bright red, and his face felt hot. He didn't
have a stage name before coming today, and when they had asked him,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Continuing to hold
Peter in place with his other arms, He pulled back both his fist and
punched Peter directly in the ribs. A cracking sound was heard, and
it the bones moving, and fracturing could be felt in Larry's
knuckles. Peter's body reacted to the attack, and the expression on
his face changed as the air was punched out of him, but no screams
were heard, as no pain was felt. </FONT></FONT>

nothing more than a wild beast. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others continued
to watch and were wondering why the referee hadn't stopped the match
yet. They could see him standing there clearly watching such a one

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the other

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone in the
arena now thought they understood why the Ref hadn't stepped in. It
must have been due to the knowledge he had known beforehand. The Ref
must have known that the student had a powerful regeneration ability.
But the truth of the matter was, that the Ref was just as shocked as
everyone else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had been informed
beforehand that the student had a transformation ability. The
audience members were too far away and the screen never focused long
enough for them to tell what level Peter's wristwatch had shown. They
all just knew he must have had a powerful regeneration ability and
now it made sense why they had allowed him to fight in the
tournament. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now as for Jack, who
was sitting in the booth, he wasn't upset by this sudden change and
surprise. Instead he was excited but at the same time concerned, for
he was thinking along the same lines as the students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had gotten so
excited, he stood up from his seat. 'This has to be the doing of
Pure!' He thought. 'Duke had already confirmed he had a
transformation ability, and before that there had been reports of him
having an earth ability. Have Pure finally managed to create a
monster?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For years
organisations, and different research institutes had dabbled in the
possibility of allowing a student to have more than one ability. Due
to the human cell's structure, it seemed impossible, but they
progressed onward. To Jack, it seemed like Pure must have been able
to finally succeed in creating a body that was able to have more than
one ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'He might be even
more important to them than I first thought.' Knowing this new piece
of information, Jack was determined to continue his plan of luring
out Pure. He was unsure whether or not they had made more people like
Peter, but even if they hadn't, they would hate the idea of the
military getting their hands on something they themselves had yet to
discover. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did I miss
much?&quot; A voice from behind Layla said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It looked like Quinn
had returned and was in one piece, which meant he must have dealt
with the problem. Layla gulped when she thought of the possibilities
of getting rid of that problem. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what
happened, is Cia…&quot; She couldn't finish her sentence for fear
of the answer she would hear back. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;She's alive,
but it's complicated.&quot; He replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Pulling off Layla to
one side, he decided it was best to explain the full details of what
had happened as soon as possible, especially since this involved her.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back at the hotel
lobby place, around the corner where the elevators were located,
Quinn was alone with Cia. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn had
activated his influence skill, her eyes had hollowed out and it
looked like his skill had worked. Before it looked like it had nearly
worked and now with his charm points increased, it seemed to just be
enough to push her over the edge. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not wanting to waste
this golden opportunity, Quinn decided it would be best to ask her
some simple questions. He had tried asking her what Pure we're
planning to do at the event. However, he quickly realized that for
some reason, any question that was about Pure would be answered with
nothing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was almost scary
even to him. Every time he would ask them a question, she would try
and search her pocket as if by automatic response. Usually, when one
was under influence they would be unable to control anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were two
things that Quinn could think of as to how this was possible. Either
his influence skill was barely working on her and she was still
fighting back. Or there was some even stronger type of mind control
going on at Pure, behind the scenes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing that she
repeatedly tried to reach into her pockets, Quinn decided to reach in
and grab whatever she was trying to get. Inside one of the pockets,
he had discovered a white pill. What its use was for he did not know.
Inside the back pocket, there seemed to be a small little white
remote. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Afraid it might have
been a recorder, or something else, Quinn had crushed it to pieces on
the spot. It would have been nice to give it to Logan but he couldn't
take any chances, and Layla had also informed him of Cia having
something like this beforehand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he was to find
such a thing he was told to destroy it on the spot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since Quinn was
unable to answer any questions, he feared that perhaps the next part
wouldn't have worked either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the tricky
part, how much did Cia know? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being an agent of
Pure she always had kept an eye on Layla and had been with her from
the beginning. If he was only to remove the events from today and the
orange portal expedition, there was a chance that Pure would be able
to fit multiple pieces of the puzzle together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He couldn't risk it,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Erase
everything.&quot; He only said two words unsure of what it might have
done. He had asked the system beforehand, and he said, she would be
able to live and talk so it should be okay, but whether or not she
could live a normal life again, he did not know. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Removing this much

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not wanting to be
there when she came too, Quinn decided to quickly head back out to
the others. He turned to look back at her one time, before deciding
to head off again. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A short time had
passed, and Cia who was on the floor had come to. She lifted herself
off the floor with a banging pain in her head. She placed her hand
making sure she wasn't injured and started looking around at her
surroundings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this
place?&quot; She asked. Then something had hit her even worse. &quot;Who
am I..What's my name?&quot; Cia couldn't remember anything. Not her
birth date, not how old she was, or even the fact she was attending
military school. The only thing she could remember was how to speak,
and her normal bodily functions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Realising this, a
natural reaction had occurred, as she broke down in tears and
screamed out. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing
everything Quinn had to say, for some reason she felt bad for Cia.
She hated Pure but not Cia herself. Still, she knew it had to be
done. Getting rid of her memories would be better than death. At

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So do you know

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;All agents
carry one with them. It's poison…&quot; Layla explained. &quot;If

exposed, we're meant to take it instantly.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's kind of

what they're planning or what will happen now?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla shook her head

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After watching the
fast-paced regeneration of the student, Silver pretty much confirmed
her suspicions. The student that was known as Peter was a Wight.
There weren't many things out there with such a fast healing speed.
The only other thing that had a similar healing speed was wendigos
but it was clear that Peter had kept most of his human appearance, so
it ruled that possibility out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that there
weren't as many fights going on, she could also concentrate and found
that there was no heartbeat. All these things led to the conclusion
that he was a Wight. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This could be a
little troublesome or fairly easy to deal with.' If the Wight was
created by Fex, then it would be impossible for her or him to kill it
and she would have to find some other way to get rid of it. There was
no way she could leave now knowing what was out and about, without a
ladder they could quickly go out of control. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it wasn't created
by Fex, then that could be even worse. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If possible, she
would have liked Fex to deal with the situation as he was able to
move about more freely within the students than she could, but if it
was created by someone else, and the Vampire turned out to be quite
powerful, it might be too much for him to handle and she would in the
end personally have to deal with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whatever the case
was, she would keep a close eye observing the Wight's strength. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no longer
any need for Peter to hold back. The military already thought he was
strange after finding out he had several abilities, the worst thing
that could happen was he would need to feed again, and that was the
worst outcome. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Knowing this and
having the element of surprise, Peter continued to walk forward
slowly. For some reason, Larry didn't know why, but he felt an
immense amount of pressure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't the fact
that Peter was giving out such a feeling, it was because someone who
he was sure he had already defeated was now walking perfectly fine.
This type of situation messed with one's head, and it didn't quite
make sense to Larry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I beat you up

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Shouting out a war
cry once again, this time, the four hands had come out of his back
before charging in. The boots on his feet slightly went a bronze
colour as he activated the equipment allowing him to move slightly
faster. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Surprisingly, Larry
was moving a lot faster then Peter had suspected, but it still wasn't
fast enough. Knowing full well he needed to avoid the attacks, at the
right time as Larry went for the grab, Peter jumped back allowing
himself to be just out of reach from the grab. With a dash, Peter
tried to go around the side, but Larry wasn't going to let him get
behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One hand retracted
from his left side, and popped out of the right side, swinging his
fist out at the same time, Peter seeing this threw a fist of his own,
but he wasn't holding back. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'You idiot, maybe
you can heal, but you can't match my power!' Larry thought. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two fists
collided and to his surprise, their strength was currently equal. One
fist didn't push back the other, but the power was so strong that the
bones in both of their fists were completely shattered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ahh!&quot;
Larry winced in pain and slightly flinched, while Peter hadn't
stopped moving. The pain had no effect, and by the time he was around
the back of Larry, his fist had already finished healing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's so fast,
are you sure he doesn't have the ability of speed as well, how can
someone move that quick?&quot; Sam thought, watching from above. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex looked over at
Quinn and thought back to when he had fought against the King tier
beast. 'That's his speed, and with the boots, Quinn was even faster
than that. If people saw Quinn fight in this event, just what would
the reaction be to him.' </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, Jack
was grinding his teeth backwards and forwards. He never expected
Peter to be this skilful. He was happy at first finding out he had
the regenerative ability as well as the transformation ability, but
this was unexpected. The aim was for him to lose the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Larry spun his body
around, hoping to slam his gauntlet fist right into Peter's head.
With the added strength of the gauntlets, his power should have
overpowered Peter's. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Peter
didn't care to dodge but instead lifted his left arm right up to his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Larry's fist had hit
Peter's arm and had shattered his forearm, but the blow was blocked.
In contrast, Peter's strike had all his power behind it, as well as
the momentum of Larry coming spinning and coming towards him. As
Peter's fist dug into his face, it had twice the power of what a
punch form Peter would usually have. </FONT></FONT>

to try to calm down, Pure hadn't come out, and he had spent a lot of
time preparing everything, and it seemed to be all a waste. Sure he
could still get his revenge just by reporting Peter or killing him in

as she thought about what to do. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She finally stood up
from her seat and opened up a digital display with all sorts of
photos and numbers on the screen. As she moved her hand slightly
above the pictures and words, they would move with it. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Agent 100 is
no longer answering her communicator; according to agent 66, she did
as asked and dropped out of the first round tournament, but due to
the events surrounding agent 72, we no longer know if the information
was received or not. The question is, why is agent 100 no longer
answering her communicator?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She then shifted her
hand and brought up agent 72's information. Beside it, there was a
photo of Cia. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;With her
memories being completely wiped, agent 72 is as good as dead to us.
We have no clue whether they were able to get anything out of her or
not. Perhaps it might not be the best idea to go ahead with the
attack after all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a tough
decision, and it all was up to agent five to make. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She closed down the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I've decided,

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A decision had been

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the rooftop of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Illegal? Who's
done something illegal? this is the first time I've heard of such a
thing,&quot; Fex replied nervously. He couldn't even look directly at
his Sister, and continued to peer out of the corner of his eye to see
what type of face she was making. When finally their two eyes met. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He regretted it
instantly as it was one that looked like a demon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No more games,
Fex, This has become a serious matter now.&quot; Silver replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was it, he
couldn't hide this from his Sister, and he had already expected a
result such as this one to happen. Knowing fully well what was going
to happen, he had already decided what he would do. He was never
going to give up his blood brother Quinn. He saved his life, and in
return, he would save his. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you create
that thing?&quot; She asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No.&quot; Fex
replied in a composed voice this time, to show this was no laughing
matter. &quot;When I arrived, he had discovered the illegal, at first
I thought one of the thirteen families had created it, but after
realizing it was a Wight, I realized its master must have been close.
I kept a close eye on who that could be and finally found out.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This piece of
information needed to be revealed to her. The Important part of Fex's
plan was he needed Silver to stop looking. Sooner or later, she would
have gone looking and found Quinn by his smell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh. Since when
did Fex become a little detective?&quot; Sliver replied. &quot;The
law states we can kill illegals on the spot. If we know the creator
is in the school, then let's finish off the illegal and return with
the Vampire.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An expected
response. His Sister was quite predictable because she always
followed the rules and tried to deal with things the quickest way
without getting others involved. This little piece of insider
information was the only thing he could rely on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly Fex went
down on one knee and placed one of his hands towards the ground. He
made sure to keep his head facing the floor to show the appropriate
respect. This was something that Vampire only did to leaders, or
lower ranks did to higher ranks. Although Silver was technically a
higher rank than Fex, due to their positions within the family, he
had never done this to her before, and it all came as a surprise. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please,
Silver, let me deal with the illegal, and I promise I will bring the
Vampire back to you tonight. You know I wanted to stay on earth as
long as possible; the truth was I knew the family would send someone
after me sooner or later. After I found an illegal here, I have been
making notes and tracking the Vampire and them down. I thought when
they would take me back if I also handed them in, there was a chance
my punishment could be made lighter. I could use it as an excuse as
to why I stayed here so long. Please give me till the end of
tomorrow, and I will bring them both to you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A part of what Fex
had said was the truth. He really had planned this. He just never
thought his Sister would be the one to get him. If he returned with
the Shadow Vampire user, then his punishment would have been light. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver thought about
this for a while. Fex had broken a severe rule but not enough to be
put into internal slumber, but there was a chance he could be put
into temporary sleep for hundreds of years. She would hate to be
apart from her brother for so long. If Fex caught these criminals,
then there was a chance the punishment could be lightened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright… I
agree with your request but two things.&quot; She said. &quot;One,
not tomorrow, you need to do everything tonight.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Tonight… but
that's too soon… there're guards and everything protecting the…&quot;
Fex said worriedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you can't
do it tonight, then I will do it myself tomorrow. This will be a test
for you and the second thing. The Vampire must be brought to me, but
the Wight must be eliminated.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He knew this was the
best he was going to get, and in a way, it was a better result then
he had expected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, I shall
bring the vampire to you…and kill the Wight.&quot; Fex answered.
The two of them quickly vanished, and now there was no longer
anything on the roof. It was as if nothing was ever there. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Walking along the
top platform slowly, Was Fex. His usual neatly swept-back black hair
was now a complete mess. The stress of everything was getting to him
and he felt like pulling his hair out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>More than felt like
it. There were times while walking where he had literally pulled out
small parts of his hair from his head. Nothing noticeable but he
didn't even realise he had been doing it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He needed everything
to go perfectly and still felt relieved that his sister had actually
agreed into letting him do everything on his own. The only problem
was he had a time limit. He needed to finish everything by tonight.
To pull everything off that he had planned, he needed some help. He
couldn't do this alone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, Fex had
arrived at the small little coffee shop where the others were sitting
outside. It was an hour later than they had planned, but it was still
only seven PM, plenty of time for the rest of the evening. Sunrise
was the time limit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, is
everything okay with you?&quot; Quinn asked, seeing the mess that
Fex's hair was in. He had been acting strange all day and now his
appearance on top of this. Something must have been wrong, and now
with the event over, he could ask. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With an awkward
smile, Fex approached Quinn and started to whisper in his ear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you mind if
just me and you can talk in private for a second, I have something
important I want to talk to you about?&quot; Fex whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this,
Quinn's heart started to beat, and slight butterflies were felt in
his stomach. If it was something that Fex only wanted him to hear
about, then it had to be something to do with vampire business. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys left
the group at the table and walked off slightly to the side. There was
no one around them to listen in on their conversation, and they could
now talk freely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what is
it?&quot; Quinn asked. &quot;Did something happen?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex went to fix his
hair up and had a nervous look on his face. He never was a good liar,
and today he had to put the performance of his life on. The only
problem was he had to do it more than once. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, you're
going to hate me for this.&quot; Fex placed his hand on top of
Quinn's shoulder and looked to the floor before lifting his head and
looking Quinn in the eye. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This is it, have
the vampires come to get Fex. Do the military know about me, what is
it?' Quinn thought nervously. His palms were now sweating, and he
just wanted Fex to blurt it out as the tension was killing him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm in love
with Layla..&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What!&quot;
Quinn shouted out so loud that the others at the table could hear. It
was something he had never expected, out of all the possibilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla, I
mean.. I mean..&quot; Quinn started to stutter his words. He was so
surprised. &quot; I thought you had a thing for Erin?&quot; Quinn
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Erin..No that
was different, she was a skilful one like a diamond, but there were
no feelings.&quot; He replied as he grasped his hands and pulled in
towards his heart. He was trying to make it seem as if this was a
painful conversation for him to have. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;With Layla,
it's true love. I know you two are quite close and I didn't know
whether you liked her either but the thing is, I don't know how much
longer I can stay here, and before I go I want her to at least know
my feelings.&quot; Fex then turned around so Quinn couldn't see his
face. He wanted to make this as dramatic as possible for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was always the
chance that Quinn might have been able to see through this type of
act. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know nothing
can ever happen between her you see and me, but I want her to at
least know, and I wanted you to know before I asked her, because
you're my blood brother right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, everything
was starting to make sense to Quinn. No wonder he had been acting so
strangely for the whole day. A confession was always a big deal. With
Layla, Quinn didn't really feel like he had any special feelings for
her. He did feel protective of her, but didn't know whether or not it
was beyond a friendship. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if he did like
her, Fex was so passionate right now. He could never deny him this
chance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But what he did know
was Fex was right. The two of them really were blood brothers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go ahead,&quot;
Quinn said. &quot;Make sure you tell her exactly how you feel.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing those
words, Fex's eyes lit up as he turned back around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's great.&quot;
He said as he started to push Quinn in the direction of the hotel.
&quot;Just head home, and I'll get the others to do the same, I plan
to do it as soon as possible.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes now, just
go,&quot; he said as he gave another small shove. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, Quinn
walked back to the hotel room with a little smile on his face. It
would be nice if two of his friends became an item. But it was a
shame if Fex did have to go back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Good luck,
brother.' Quinn thought as he returned to his hotel room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing Quinn walk
off and away like that, the others who were at the coffee table were
wondering just what was going on. The two of them seemed to be so
dramatic about something and were a little worried that Quinn had
disappeared off somewhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, that quickly
changed when they saw Fex walking towards them. He didn't have a face
of joy or laughter like he did when talking to Quinn. This was the
face of business. With his two hands, he swept back his hair and sat
down in one of the seats that was placed around the table and the
aura that was coming off him was suffocating them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

around, but this time I'm serious. You may have many questions, but I

for a moment to see if anyone of them wanted to say something there

to listen in carefully. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good, The
vampires have discovered me, and they know about Peter. They don't
know about Quinn yet, but it's only a matter of time. I want to first
say this is my fault. They only came because of me, but after finding
out about Peter, they can't let him live. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;To explain
quickly, he is something called an illegal. Vampires do not have
permission to create others without notifying their leader. Since
Quinn created Peter without a leader's permission, Peter is
considered an illegal. Usually, when we discover an illegal, they are
executed on the spot, as for the one who created him. They are taken
back to the vampire council to be judged for their crime. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, I Have no
intention of turning Quinn into them. Ever since I got here, he has
done so much for me. But they won't leave until I give them the
Vampire that turned Quinn. With that, I have a plan. Luckily Peter
knows the transformation skill, if we give him disguised as Quinn
that should be able to satisfy them. I will report back saying I have
killed the illegal while also giving them a fake Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

I need your help. There are a few problems with this. Everything
needs to be done today. I have told them I would deal with
everything. I will be going to break out Peter and for that, I think
Logan you will be the best to help me. The second thing might be an
even bigger problem. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Even when I
spoke to him earlier, he still thinks there is a way to save Peter.
The truth is, this might be the only way to save him. The humans will
experiment on him to no end, but the vampires will at least give him
a quick death. Giving Peter to them is not enough to fool them. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We can smell

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;During my time
here, I have come to the conclusion that Vorden, you are the closest
to Quinn. Whatever it takes you must fill up that flask with his own
blood, but it's important he does not find out about this. I have a
suggestion which I think only you could do, and that's to knock Quinn
and force the blood from him. He is a curious one, if you try to come
up with an excuse thier is a good chance he will follow you, and it
will ruin the whole plan. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex had finished
detailing out everything to the others, and they couldn't quite
believe it. Both Logan and Vorden had suspected something like this
would happen one day; they just didn't expect it to happen in the

have time to prepare, they would have to act immediately. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have no

question. Surely, sooner or later, they will find out that Peter is
not the person they are looking for. What happens then? Will they
come to look for Quinn again and what will happen to you once they
found out you tricked them?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The serious face on
Fex had changed to quite a sad-looking one after hearing this
question. It was almost as if he had prepared himself for something.
&quot;The vampires are careful ones. It will be a while before they
send someone after Quinn. At least this will give him more time.
Quinn is special even though I know that, he gets stronger by the
day. As for your second question, that is not for you to worry about

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the middle of
Fex's explanation, after hearing and learning that the matter had
something to do with Quinn, a particular person had found out that he
could be in trouble. In the dark backroom of Vorden's mind, Sil had
stood up and was interested in what they had to say. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most things seemed

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He listened
carefully while standing by Vorden on his left side and Raten was

Vorden to gather Quinn's blood. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well...of
course, we're not going to agree to that right?&quot; Raten asked.
&quot;Hey, I know I'm crazy, and I'll fight anything, but do you
remember what happened last time? He turned into that bald-headed
monster. Sorry, but I'm not fighting in this one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry... I

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing what
Raten had to say, Vorden was concerned and was hesitant whether or
not to agree to the plan. Quinn was definitely strong. If it was the
Quinn from a few months back, then maybe without Raten's help and a
strong ability, he would be able to knock Quinn out and gather some
blood. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, he would
need at least two strong abilities to increase his chances. It wasn't
just a question of winning such a fight, but being strong enough to
overpower Quinn to the point where he could win without having to
badly hurt him. </FONT></FONT>

anything right now and needed a backup plan in case that didn't work.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It looked like Fex's

to head back to her hotel room and prepare whatever she thought might
help. In her room, there were still a few items she had from Pure
that should be able to help block out the cameras around the place.

made some preparations of his own. He didn't actually expect her to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside her hotel

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time though,
the black ball looked a little different than before, as a blue

but his reactions were far quicker than the boys. Releasing that
Vorden's intent was not to hurt him, he quickly thought that there
must have been some other reason for this strange attack. There was
no power behind this strike, and it was too sudden in front of too
many people. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Vorden was
persistent and tried again with his other hand, but that too was
knocked away. Not knowing Vorden's true intentions, Owen stepped back
and initiated a small spark in his right hand. It was out of sight
for others to see since his body was blocking most of it, plus he had
purposely made it very small. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a warning. If

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The look in Vorden's
eyes suddenly changed, even being felt by Owen. He had never felt
such a strong presence come from a student before. He thought that he
was right to think those kids from before were interesting. Using the
fan, he covered the bright smile on his face. Never before had a
student made him feel this way. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his sizeable
white gown and hair covering his face, Owen wasn't very recognisable
to the outside people. Unlike the other family leaders, no one knew
what he looked like. Today was the first time the newly appointed
head was revealed, and that was only found out to the people in the
booth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sure, there were
some like Quinn and his group who had paid attention to who was
sitting in those seats. But none that knew about the situation. When
looking at someone so young, they would have never suspected them of
being a leader. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The people around

happening off to the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were far too
involved in their own things or the gaming centre that was close by.
After learning about Vorden's true name, he had no choice and gave
his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The excitement that
was felt when following this student now turned into horror. Although
his heart was beating rapidly and he was a little scared, there still
was a little spark in the back of his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I wonder why he
needs to borrow my power?' His curiosity to find out new and exciting
things had always been his downfall. He even felt that his current
views were different from the head and those around him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Owen was always
interested in the younger generation who was closer to his age. He
wanted to know how they felt about the way things were currently run.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, if he was
to try to get involved or intervene in a situation like this, it
would have possibly been one of the most dangerous things to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you.&quot;
Vorden said, letting go of Owen's hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No matter how
interested Owen was, now was not the time to get involved with such a
dangerous individual. He took a few steps back and planned to get
away but seeing his actions Vorden called out to him immediately. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait.&quot;
Vorden called out. &quot;I want you to take me to where the other
leaders are.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this came as
a considerable shock to Owen, was he planning to use their powers
too? The big four leaders powers were beyond a level 8 ability. It
was to the point where it couldn't be measured. When looking at
Vorden, it was clear he was a student, whoever he had trouble with or
whoever he needed to deal with. Just his power alone should have been
enough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now the excitement
was too much, and he had even forgotten to hide the grin on his face.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Maybe the events
won't be so boring after all.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no choice, Owen
walked, and Vorden followed behind. On the way, they quickly went to
one of the stalls to purchase a change of clothing for Vorden. He too
was now in a large white gown that was a little too big, as part of
the back was dragging along the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is this really
necessary?&quot; He asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course.&quot;
Owen chuckled as the two of them, continued to walk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, they had
reached their destination. It was a hotel room that was slightly
larger and fancier than the rest, Hotel number one. This was where
all of the higher class members that were invited to the event were
staying. The rest had to get a train out to other parts of the city
and come in early in the morning. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before entering the
building, the two of them stopped outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
how to use my powers?&quot; Owen asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not
everything, but I should be able to do something.&quot; Vorden
replied as he started to twirl his hand around. Particular elemental
abilities were quite similar in use but reacted differently when
being used. An example of this was when gathering water. To gather
water and wind, one did the same thing, but water would be a bit
harder to control due to the weight and shape of it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When twirling his
hand in a circular motion, he tried to imagine the ability as a water
one. Suddenly following the palm of his hand, a stream of electric
would follow it. He continued to move his hands in a circular motion,
and now a full circle of blue electrical light could be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quick learner
as expected,&quot; Owen said, impressed. &quot;The kids at our school
would cry in horror if they found out you could produce something
like that on your first try.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Owen then opened up
two of his fingers and created a connected spark, passing the blue
lightning between his thumb to his finger. &quot;This should do,
there is no need to perform what you did before.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the quick
lesson over, the two of them walked up to the front of the hotel
lobby where the guards were stationed. Owen was allowed to pass but
Vorden was stopped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That kid is
with me, he is a member of the Graylash family.&quot; Owen said with
a wink towards Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He suddenly realised
why now they had the quick lesson before. Opening up his thumb and
his index finger, he had presented to the guards the same trick that
Owen had shown moments before. There was no better proof that one was
part of the Graylash family other than displaying it with their
powers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, this
wouldn't have been enough, but with one of the big four, who was also
considered one of the leaders of the current United Earth Alliance.
They allowed him to pass. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The elevator was
taken to one of the top floors, and when they arrived, there were
only a few rooms with large doors. These doors all had different
decorations on the outside. In the centre of the double door going
over the parting point. Was the engraving of the family's crest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'No guards?' Vorden
noticed. This was upon the request of the four themselves. They
preferred it this way. Secrecy was a big part of thier power, and
Vorden knew that better than anyone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, they were
standing in front of what looked like a large shield with a flame on
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Owen knocked on the
door and was quite pleased he would be interacting with Burnie once
again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Those blasted
soldiers, I told them not to disturb me. I'm going to have to speak
to Owen about this. This treatment is unacceptable.&quot; The
ramblings of a deep voice man could be heard through the doors. It
seemed like the man was trying to speak quietly, but he had one of
those voices that would be carried and heard throughout no matter
what. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The doors flew open
wide and fast and in its place was a large round-bellied man, with
messy Red hair. The trait of the Sunshield family. The instant the
doors opened, Burnie's ears started to produce steam at the sight of
the man in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You.&quot; He
pointed at Owen. &quot;So it looks like you really wanted that fight
after all. To come to my room in the middle of the night.&quot; He
had completely ignored the person standing next to him and continued
to focus only on Owen </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In case things got
ugly, Owen had placed his hand on his metallic fan. Vorden now
realised if he was planning to use such a weapon against one of the
big four, it couldn't have been a regular fan but a high-class beast
weapon instead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As much as I
would like to teach you to not judge a book by its cover. I have come
for over reasons.&quot; Owen tried to explain, but it seemed like
Burnie wasn't listening at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Flames from both of
his forearms were slowly starting to appear upward towards his elbow,
and a red hot tribal pattern was shown on his skin. This was
something Vorden hadn't seen when he thought with Berg. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is it part of his
soul weapon.&quot; Realising this, there was a chance this fight
could get serious fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Owen quickly stepped
to the side and presented both of his hands at Vorden. &quot;This man
is part of the Blade family, and he has asked for our assistance.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing the name,
Burnies reaction had immediately changed just like Owen's. The flames
had died down, and the tribal Tattoos that went up his arm
disappeared as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Burnie gave the
person next to him one look, and knew what he wanted instantly, and
presented his hand while looking away, making sure not to make eye
contact. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If that's all
you came for, get out of here. I was just about to take a nice hot
bath.&quot; Burnie said but now with a lot less anger in his voice.
Making sure to not offend the person in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now with two of the
strongest powers in the world, Vorden was confident he could deal
with Quinn. There was no need for him to get the Bree family power
and inform more people that he was here. Her power was to control
beasts, and there weren't any around here, besides, even if there
were it would be too difficult to move and would cause a huge uproar.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then there was only
Jack left. The newest addition to the big families. Unlike the other
families, it had no history and was only recently created. The others
had been going on for generations even before the war with the Dalki.
If Vorden was to ask him for anything, he wasn't even sure he would
comply. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, there was
another reason. With this much power following through his body, if
he was to meet Jack right now, there was a good chance he wouldn't
hold back and burnt him to a crisp. It was quite possible it would
ignite a war, and that wasn't his decision to make. He wasn't the
leader of the Blade family, and if they found out he was abusing
their name like this, even he could get into trouble. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't have
to tell you guys that I was never here.&quot; Vorden said. &quot;but
before I go. I need one more thing, is there a place or spot I can
use where no one will know if I'm using these powers?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Burnie huffed out a
puff of hot air before answering. &quot;There is, I often use it to
cool down once in a while. They created the room with me in mind, and
of course, there are no cameras, even if they were everything would
have been burnt by now. It's an empty room with nothing inside, and
the walls are soundproof. Whatever you're planning to do in there
nobody will be able to tell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a place

for them to make.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perfect.&quot;
Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two leaders had
scary thoughts in their mind at what possibly could Vorden need the
room for, and why did he need the two of their powers, but they
didn't ask and only told Vorden where to go.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the timer
had gone off, a few little spiders started falling down to the ground
from underneath Logan's sleeve. The two boys continued their fake
conversation with hand gestures and such. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what's
your favourite sandwich?&quot; Fex asked, trying to make the
conversation look a tad bit more realistic by asking a real question.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Logan
looked as if he was really struggling to decide his answer. He placed
his hand on his chin and looked up into a corner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hmm, I would
probably have to say cheese and onion. But since my body doesn't deal
with cheese that well... I guess if we were talking about favourites,
then it would depend on my cravings at the time. Regarding how the
question is phrased, the best sandwich differs. Do you mean the best
tasting? Best one for your health? Or perhaps the best ingredients?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Eh, I guess
you can tell me all three then?&quot; Fex's tone had a nervous vibe
to it, as he wasn't expecting a real answer back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The spiders had now
fanned out, and once they had completed their tasks, they reported
back to the server, namely, Logan. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the middle of
their intense conversation, Logan suddenly stopped and stood up.
&quot;Let's go.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The underground
arena was accessible from any hotel room. It was designed this way so
when contestants were eliminated, they could easily rejoin with their
military base. This meant that each of the elevators were in some way
linked. One would usually require a pass to go to the lower floors,
but that wasn't a problem to worry about. Not for Logan anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued
walking through the lobby and headed towards the elevator area. Fex
glanced at the camera in the corner and could see a spider falling
from it before rejoining back up with Logan. Once the doors opened,
they both stepped in. The cameras within and outside the elevators
weren't able to capture their figures. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The cameras were set
to loop footage for two minutes, once the time was up, it would then
begin showing the live feed. It was currently night time and there
were no other contestants that would be making their way from the
underground up to the lobby. Once they were past these cameras, there
would be no more problems since there were no other cameras in the
underground section. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan could assume
this was due to the same reason why there weren't any cameras at the
school. Many students would be practising their abilities. Their
families simply wouldn't allow them to spy and gather information by
looking at what the students were doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While in the
elevator the two of them placed both their masks over their face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So far,
everything's going well,&quot; Fex confidently commented. &quot;Now,
Vorden, Layla, it's all up to you. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without the blood,
everything they were doing was pointless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden told Layla to
meet him just outside of the number one military hotel building. He
even informed her that he found a place and everything was ready. All
she needed to do now was bring Quinn over to the destination. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since he already
told her of his plan beforehand, there was no need for her to use her
tools. There would be no cameras inside when Quinn entered the room
with Vorden, her job there was to be the lookout. Although only
members from the big four could use the room, that didn't mean they
themselves wouldn't. However, there was still the slight chance that
Mona Bree or Jack would try to use it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Burnie had informed
Vorden that this was extremely unlikely, in all the years the place
had been built, it was never once used by them. In fact, he reckoned
that he was the only one to have ever used the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She stood outside
Quinn's door and took a deep breath before raising her hand to knock.
It felt like the work she was doing now was more like the
double-agent-type-stuff back when she was in Pure. These were the
things that she had been trained to do, it seemed a little funny that
she was still using it despite already leaving them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, let's do
this!&quot; Just as Layla was about to tap the door with her
knuckles, it suddenly opened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla, what
are you doing here this late?&quot; Quinn asked her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But... How…?&quot;
She started asking questions in her mind. 'How did he know someone
was by the door?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh... You
don't need to worry, I could smell you were coming&quot; Quinn
responded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Smell?&quot;
These words stung her a bit. She was tempted to lift her arms up to
see if she really did smell that bad. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Upon seeing that she
felt somehow insulted, Quinn realized that what he said just now
could have been easily misinterpreted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No! I didn't
mean that you smell... I meant like, you smell great,&quot; he said
while blushing. &quot;You know, because of my sensitive nose and
all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The both of them
left the room and headed outside towards the military base once Layla
said that she wanted to walk for a bit and that she had something
important to say. Quinn thought that he already knew what the subject
would be. It had to be about Fex's confession. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two of them
were walking, they felt a little awkward because of their previous
conversation at the door. Quinn didn't know what to say to make it up
to her. While pondering over this matter, Quinn had fallen back a
little and was walking just behind Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He noticed that he
was staring at her from behind a lot more than usual. Due to this, he
started to think back about what Fex said, about how he wanted to
inform him beforehand since he assumed that there was something going
on between the two of them. And now, Layla asked to have a private
conversation with him as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'No... It can't
be…Does Layla like me? When she asked him to turn her, did she mean
something else by it?' His mind couldn't help but have these kinds of
thoughts. 'If Layla likes me... and Fex likes her, then that means...
Oh no! I'm in a love triangle! If she's here to confess to me, then
what do I say? I can't say yes to her… I can't do this to Fex.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While his mind
wandered about in this confused and crazy contemplation, the both of
them eventually arrived outside a small building behind the hotel.
Although it was very plain-looking, it was also large at the same
time. This reminded Quinn of the storage room where he first found
the Shadow Ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wondered why
Layla chose this place to converse with him, he could only guess it
was due to it being away from everyone else. Layla then turned around
and faced him. It looked as if she wanted to say something, but was
also struggling on how to say it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know what
you want to talk about.&quot; Quinn decided to initiate the
discussion. He didn't want the situation to be more awkward than it
already was. &quot;This is about Fex, isn't it?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'How does he know?'
She was surprised once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Feeling a bit
contemplated, she started to speak, &quot;Look Quinn–&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You don't need
to say anymore..&quot; However, Quinn suddenly interrupted her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, Vorden
is waiting for you inside,&quot; She blurted out before things really
got out of hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Wait…Vorden? How
is he involved in all of this?' Quinn was now truly confused about
what was going on </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, I just
felt bad about lying, saying that I needed to speak to you. The truth
is, Vorden said that he wanted to talk to you. He's inside waiting.&quot;
Layla then walked over to the metallic-looking doors and inputted the
code that Vorden told her. It really was nearly the same storage room
back on the red portal planet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Quinn
moved to the entrance, but he stopped just outside of it. Could he
really trust Layla? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because he didn't
know what was going on, Quinn was starting to think that this was
possibly a trap set up by Pure. Perhaps Layla was planning to
double-cross him and was still working with them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is Vorden
really inside here?&quot; Quinn turned around and asked while looking
at her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment, a
hand suddenly pulled him from behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just get in
here, you idiot!&quot; Vorden's voice suddenly piped up, he shuffled
both him and Quinn inside as the doors shut closed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the
motion-sensor lights automatically turned on, they could both see
that they were in a large plain white room. There were no windows
around, there was nothing except the door they just entered from. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn turned
around and saw Vorden, his worries settled down since it seemed like
Layla was telling the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The look on Vorden's
face was not one which greeted a friend, but instead, it was of
concern. In just an instant, his expression changed, Vorden now had
the friendliest smile that Quinn had ever seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Eh? Vorden,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden?&quot;
He responded while tilting his head to the side and placing his
finger on his lips. &quot;No, I'm not Vorden, did you forget my
name?&quot; He responded with a question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This strange
reaction made Vorden look almost like a handsome blonde-haired puppy.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What's going on?'

Quinn</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were two
outcomes between the situation with Vorden and Quinn. In Vorden's
head, the best outcome would be for him to ask Quinn to put his blood
in the flask kindly. If Quinn were to question why, he would simply
tell him to trust him, and he would inform him about the details
tomorrow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, knowing
Quinn, he would try to get involved some way or another. On top of
that, he would try following him. If the first part of the plan
worked, then Vorden would hand the flask to Layla while keeping an
eye on Quinn, making sure he didn't leave the room until everything
was done. Hopefully, this would all lead to avoiding him fighting
with Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then again, Vorden
was someone who always needed to prepare himself for all of the
possible scenarios. There was a good chance that when asking for his
blood, Quinn wouldn't do so without saying why, leading him to
forcefully take the blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In both cases, these
would lead to a fight. If this was to happen, Vorden wanted the fight
to be over as quickly as possible, which meant he would need to
utilise both of the abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second Vorden
had pushed Quinn into the room. He had made the switch with Sil, so
if anything were to happen, they would be ready. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, so
remember what we've planned?&quot; Vorden asked, standing right next
to him. Sil was currently in the seat and Raten was standing a little
bit further away from them with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you think
for a second that this will go the way you expect it to go, then
you're crazy,&quot; Raten said out loud with a little chuckle,
waiting for disaster to strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Repeat after
me. I need you to trust me Quinn, and I need you to do me a favour. I
don't want you to ask why, but I need some of your blood,&quot; said
Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the words
were simply ignored as Sil decided to do his own thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But I'm not
Vorden. Did you forget my name? I'm Sil.&quot; he said outward,
looking at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing Vorden
speak, it seemed a little strange to Quinn. Although it sounded like
him, at the same time, it didn't. The emphasis on certain words, as
well as the fluctuations in his voice, were just a tad off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not just that, but
the way he was currently standing. Everything just felt wrong, and
now he was saying his name was Sil? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
doing, Sil?!&quot; Vorden could not help but shout. &quot;He can't
find out about you!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sil turned his head
and looked at Vorden behind him before responding, &quot;Shut up. I
can do what I want. It's my body anyway.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden gulped as he
took a step back. There was nothing he could do when Sil got like
this. So he decided to just wait and see the outcome. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's been a
while since we've last met.&quot; Sil giggled. &quot;Let me ask you
something. Are we friends?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a brief
pause as Quinn was trying to figure out just what was going on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course we
are, Vorden,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sil shook his head
rapidly back and forth as he stomped his feet in a peculiar manner.
At the same time, flames from his feet rose into the air before
dissipating. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No!&quot; He
yelled. &quot;Not Vorden. I already told you. I'm Sil.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing a fire
ability appear all of a sudden made Quinn take a few steps back. He
knew this power belonged to one of the big four, so he could not help
but wonder why Vorden currently had it. Something strange was
happening here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Sil...why does
Vorden keep referring to himself as Sil?' While thinking of this,
Quinn started to think about the possibilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did Pure get to
him? Or has someone with a mind control ability taken over Vorden's
body? Perhaps, it might have even been a vampire.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't fully
understand the capabilities of the vampires, so he thought this might
have been their way to try and get rid of him once they found out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whatever the case
was, it was clear that the person in front of him right now, wasn't
the Vorden he knew. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why are you
stepping back?&quot; Sil said as he reached out his hand. &quot;Don't
be scared. Why are you scared….&quot; Suddenly, tears started to
flow from his eyes. They ran down his cheek before trickling to the
ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't be
scared… Don't be scared…&quot; He continued to mumble as he
looked at Quinn. &quot;Please don't be scared, Caser. I promise I
will never hurt you again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the words
spoken were quiet, with Quinn's hearing, he could hear every word. He
heard him speak of a name, which he did not know of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please, Sil,&quot;
Vorden yelled, trying one more time to reach out to him. He knew that
if this went on, perhaps Quinn would be seriously hurt. The goal was
only to get his blood and nothing more. &quot;Quinn is not Caser, we
need him. We are here to help him, right? You don't want him to go,
so just ask for the blood…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Making sure to not
be too pushy, this was all that he could do while he silently prayed.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The words had gotten
through to him, as Sil saw the worried look on his face. He grabbed
his hand and placed it towards his chest while wiping his tears away
with the other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's right.
You are not Caser.&quot; Looking up, he gave a smile. &quot;Please
remember my name next time. It's Sil. Since we're friends, I need to
ask you for a favour.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sil then went to his
side and pulled out the metallic flask that had been given to him by
Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I need you to
fill this up with your blood.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
flask, Quinn noticed it in an instant. That was because it was the
same one that he had been gifted with by Fex. This was the deciding
factor in his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'The vampires must
have gotten to Vorden.' Somehow, they had found out. It was probably
the reason why Fex had been acting strangely before. He now felt
stupid for believing such an obvious lie. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did he betray me?'
Quinn pondered. Perhaps, when he asked Quinn to leave that day, the
vampires came and surrounded his friends. After that, they forced
them to complete this task. He didn't know why they needed his blood,
but he still had a lot to learn about vampires in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then again, there
was the possibility that they couldn't kill him outright due to him
actually being one of the leaders. Still, whatever the case was,
Quinn wasn't going to go down without a fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry. I
can't,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;And Vorden, I don't know how, but I
promise I'll save you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With nothing left to
say, Quinn activated his Shadow Quip ability. Dark shadows quickly
covered his arms and legs, as well his new chest piece in the centre.
He then quickly charged forward and left the clouds of shadows
behind, but right now, his body was all of his equipment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know how
strong you are, Vorden. Hence the reason why I can't go easy on you.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quick, Sil!
Take him out now!&quot; Vorden shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sil quickly curled
up, bringing his arms and head towards his chest. He then gathered
the power of the fire energy around the centre. Soon, little flames
could be seen on top of all his clothing. Slowly, they started to
burn away even at the fire-resistant school uniform. The fire power
was too strong. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn started to
get closer, he could sense something was up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shadow
Control.&quot; Lifting up the shadow in front of him, he made sure to
have it ready, prepared as a shield for whatever was to come. Once
Vorden attacked, that's when Quinn would strike using his blood
abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the moment, he
still hadn't used his blood bank, nor his own flask, so his HP was
low. This was another reason for him wanting to finish off the fight
fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Enough time had
passed, and Sil was ready. He suddenly extended his hands and head
outward like a spring, causing a dome of fire to be released outward,
heading in all directions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was nothing
Quinn could do but brace himself with his shadow. As the outer edge
of the fire dome grew closer, it had finally hit his shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the fire
had touched Quinn's shadow, it had disappeared in an instant,
consuming all of his MC cells. This could have only meant one thing.
The attack was just too powerful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Who's fire ability
did he copy?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the shadow
was able to cause a small crack in the dome, allowing him to pass
through and come out of the attack unharmed. But now, with no more MC
cells, he could no longer rely on his shadow ability, only leaving
him with his blood abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'It seems I have no
choice. I have to use my blood bank. I'll just curb my addiction next
time.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But before he could
even do that, a blue stream of light flashed before his eyes, and
Sil, who was on the other side of the room, was now directly in front
of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go to sleep,
my dear Quinn,&quot; Sil said as he placed his hand on top of Quinn's
head, and unleashed a fury of electricity through his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His body shook
rapidly back and forth as the electricity passed through. He gritted
his teeth, trying to take the pain, but it was too much for him as
his vision slowly faded to black. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

turned out better then he thought. Everything was easier then it
would have been anywhere else, and the reason was that the military
had kept to the same routine down to the last second. There were a

might not have needed them. When walking through certain hallways,

be during the event when the soldiers were busy and spread thin. If
they caused a panic, they would be to busy with dealing with the

measures and never expected someone from the inside to do anything. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Their main concern
was with others or the students seeing them, so this was better for
them all together. The two guards who were stationed at the front
door were where Fex would come into play. The two of them stood just
around the corner from Peter's room silently as they waited for the

had successfully knocked out Quinn, they would act. If not, they
would turn around and abandon the whole thing. They needed to wait
because the only thing they could do at this point was to knock out
the two guards in front of them and take Peter away. Logan had timed
everything, so the shift change had just happened. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From around the
corner of the corridor, two spiders were released once again. They
scaled up the wall and went above on the ceiling. They walked until
they were just above the two soldiers' heads. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You ready?&quot;
Logan asked as he could see Fex was fiddling with a string in his
hand. This string was different from the usual type he would use.
When Fex used his abilities before it would always be nearly
invisible to the eye, but this string was dyed red like blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ability had been
infused with his vampire blood abilities to make it several times
stronger. The only problem was it took some preparation time to use. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was why he was
unable to use it against the king tier beast before, at the same time
he had already deemed it would be useless, for the king tier beast
was far too strong. Still, for situations like this, it was perfect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex was finally
ready, he gave the nod, and at the same time the spiders fell down
hovering above the neck of the guards. Both of them felt something
ticklish on their neck. One soldier tired slapping it, while another
turned around trying to fling whatever was on him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This small
distraction was all that was needed for Fex to whip out his blood-red
strings. Quickly they wrapped around their mouths like a spider web,
before wrapping around their legs and pulling them to the ground.
Then finally, their whole arms and legs had been covered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They tried to break
free from the strings, but it was nearly impossible for them. The
spiders continued to move along their body, as it scanned for any
traces of equipment that could give them away. The only thing that
was found was a tracker that had been placed along with an alert
button. However, the alert hadn't been pressed, so it was best to
leave everything as it was for now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
entered the room, and they could see Peter standing there still. He
had heard the commotion outside and was wondering just what was going
on, but he had never expected to see these two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had already
given up hope on being saved. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't thank us

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back above ground,
Vorden had now switched back with Sil. He had just sent a report to
the others to proceed with what they were doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He hadn't extracted
the blood yet as Fex had given him a warning and they needed to wait
for the timing. He knew that Quinn was currently going through
getting rid of his addiction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex never knew about
the connection Vorden had and never expected him to be able to get
powers so powerful. He had hoped with Quinn going through the
addiction, he would be weak enough to the point where it was easier
for him to be knocked out and it seemed like it had worked. There
were many times when Vorden had watched Quinn, he appeared to have
been given two or three chances, as if he had more lives than one,
but this time that hadn't happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, this also
meant there was a chance that during the fight, Quinn would be close
to turning into a Blood sucker. He had been informed that there
should be a flask similar on Quinn's body. Vorden searched and found
an exact replica. The next step was to wait patiently for the others
to get back to him, or until there were signs that Quinn was starting
to change. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything seemed to
have fallen into place. Layla had entered the room and was now
standing by Quinn's side, both of them looking at Quinn's body. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think he'll
be pissed, but he will understand. He will soon realise if he was in
our shoes, he would have done the same thing.&quot; Vorden replied.
As he pulled out a small little dagger and proceeded to cut Quinn on
the arm. Blood started seeping from the wound and fell into the
flask. </FONT></FONT>

situation. They informed him of the plan and troubles that came with
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without hesitation,
after being told what needed to be done, Peter had agreed. After
hearing this was all for Quinn's sake, he was happy he would actually
be of some help to his creator and saviour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the sudden
response seemed strange, Fex thought. Sure, Wights were loyal to
their creators, but not like this. One would have to command an order
and be forced to do so due to the bond of blood, but Peter seemed to
have been so accepting over the whole thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't
guarantee what will happen to you when they find out,&quot; Fex said.
&quot;You could be killed.&quot; The words spoken were trying to
deter him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay,&quot;
Peter replied. &quot;Better than being left in the hands of the
humans. Besides, if I stayed, there is a good chance they would find
out about all of you, and I wouldn't want anything to happen.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing these words
had put a smile on Logan`s face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, you
really did change for the better. And I don't think it's just cause
you're a Wight now.&quot; said Logan. &quot;When you first evolved,
you seemed cruel and distant, but those words right there. They
didn't come from the Wight version of you or the old Peter. Right
now, I see a new man.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing Logan's
words just confirmed Fex's strange thoughts further.. Wights were
relatively short-tempered and evil in nature. Sure Peter had shown
this a few times, but it wasn't to the degree of Wights that he knew.
Perhaps this was the influence of Quinn's will on the creator. It was
a shame as it seemed to be progressing slowly; Peter started to
change away from the standard Wight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After parting ways
from the others, Peter was taken to a safe, secluded place out on the
platform, away from the meeting point with Silver, as well as away
from the others. The masks were now returned, and right now, Peter
had transformed his face to look like Quinn. If anyone were to see
the two of them, they would just think they were nothing more than
two students having a laugh. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no chance
for someone else to spot Quinn either, as Vorden was keeping an eye
on him in the special training room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you hate
me?&quot; Fex asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No,&quot;
Peter replied instantly but gave nothing more back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I hate me,&quot;
Fex said. &quot;You know I thought I might get attached to this place
and hate to go back home. What I didn't expect was that I would get
attached to the people rather than the place. I can't help but think
that they all had to go through this just because of my selfish
wants.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The vampires
would have come for Quinn anyway,&quot; Peter replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean by that?&quot; Fex asked. There was no reason to send any of the
vampires to the military base. They had only come out to search for
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter hadn't replied
because he didn't know why the vampires would come after Quinn. All
he knew was before, Quinn would often say that, it seemed like for
some reason he was trying to get stronger as fast as possible, as if
he was preparing for a threat ahead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I think I
know,&quot; Fex said, giving his own answer and coming to his own
conclusion as usual. It had to be something to do with the shadow
powers. There was a good chance that Quinn's master was part of the
old punishers. If they were still around. If the others knew about
this, they certainly would send people after him. Even if Quinn's
master wasn't a punisher, the others would want to get their hands on
Quinn's power for themselves and find out which family was in charge
of Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I never did find
out the truth behind him.' Fex at first was very curious but soon
felt bad about trying to find details of what he would now call a
friend back .It just felt wrong and wasn't in his nature to do things
like that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Here, take
this,&quot; Fex said as he handed the flask over to Peter. After
opening the lid, Peter gulped down the whole drink in one go and
suddenly had a strange feeling in his chest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was something he
hadn't felt in a while, and it was all a little alien to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The sound…my

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the blood fell
down his throat and reached his heart, strange energy was felt all
around. The blood was now being pumped from the heart all over the
body. He could feel it moving through his veins. It felt as if his
insides were on fire. For anyone else, it would be a painful
experience, but for Peter, it was a joy. For it was the first time he
had felt pain in a while. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this?&quot;
Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's your
master's blood; usually, there would be no reason to do this to a
wight. Their strengths are the fact that they can't feel pain; if
anything, this makes you seem more human. Anyway, don't be too happy,
the effects are temporary.&quot; Fex explained. &quot;Our powers come
from our blood, and right now, Quinn's power is inside you. Right
now, the feeling, the smell, and even the look. With all this, I
wouldn't be able to tell who I was looking at. As in terms of powers,
although your attacks and such will be healthy, you still can't
produce any blood attacks like we are. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Also, I would
urge you not to fight or test out any of your powers. At most, I see
this lasting a week. Day by day, the power will slowly start to fade,
and sooner or later, they will find out. If you start using that
extra strength of yours, it will only go away quicker.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex then took a deep
breath as he started to walk off to one of the military bases. &quot;Leave
all the talking to me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, Silver
was waiting patiently on top of the roof of building four. In her
hand was a rectangular looking device that looked identical to the
one in Logan's room. It was a portable teleporter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She had trust that
her brother would complete the task, although he was a fool, he
wasn't one to break promises. When he said he would finish it, she

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh.&quot;
Silver replied, seeing that the person she had brought with them was
still fully conscious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you
requested, this is the vampire who had made an illegal. I had been
tailing him a while and explained everything that happened. When I
told him that a vampire knight was here to catch him, he immediately
turned himself in, knowing there was no need to fight.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A vampire knight, a
class that was designated just below the vampire leader. It was a
unique role as each family was able to designate only two vampire
knights in their family. They would mostly be in charge of running
things or giving orders if the vampire leader wasn't present. Because
of this reason, to be able to be elected into such a position, one
would need a strong power to keep the others in line. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the beautiful
women in front of him, Peter felt nothing. Yet, for some reason, that
seemed to worry him even more. When he had first encountered Fex, his
wild energy could be felt throughout; one could tell he was strong.
But with Silver, it was calm; it was as if she wasn't even there yet
clearly she stood right in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And what of
the illegal.&quot; She asked. &quot;I have taken care of him and
gotten rid of the body, but since he and this one are registered
students. They will soon find out about them. I suggest we leave as
soon as possible.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver walked over
to Fex slowly; the sound of her boots hitting the floor was heard.
Everything had been prepared for this moment, and he had answered
perfectly, now he just needed her to believe him. However, he was too
afraid and didn't want to look up for even a second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, he felt a
hand on his hair. Silver ruffled it up and gave it a little pat. &quot;You
have done well, little brother. I will tell the family of your good
deeds here, and they shall lighten the punishment.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The square portal
device was placed on the ground, and a unique digital number was
imputed. The contraption started to open itself up slowly piece by

following form behind. Soon after, Silver threw a small circular ball
on the floor and stepped through herself. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you
remember a while ago when I said if there were some things you found
out about me, I would have to kill you?&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;At
the time, it probably seemed like a joke, but I was quite serious.
There are some secrets that even I have, Quinn, but that's not
important right now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The trust between
the two of them had been partially broken, and Vorden could see that.

the details of what had happened and why. What Fex's part in all of
this was and what his part of it was as well. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Honestly, I'm
not too sure. It seems like a lot of time has passed, and as the

relatively close to tradition. A trial will be placed where the

with you, they will kill Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No.&quot; The

them of who you are now, and you will become a target of them in an

to the tenth family. And don't give me this crap that you can't tell
me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

patiently tapping away at a desk in the corner. Standing by his side

The bright light shined on his golden hair and handsome face. When
looking at him now, the sadness in his eyes made him look like an
abandoned prince. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wanted to
tell you about yesterday, before you go asking. You're right; it's
not fair that I keep all my secrets while I know all of yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn himself was
now feeling a little guilty as he hadn't told the others everything,
but it wasn't like it was a big deal to explain to them how his
powers worked. How it was a game like a system, even if he did tell
them it wouldn't have changed anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How much do
you remember before you were knocked out?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You mean when
you were screaming that your name wasn't Vorden and you were Sil. Or
when you nearly roasted me like a chicken before then zapping me?&quot;
Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, it looks
like you remember everything then.&quot; Said Vorden. &quot;Like I
said, yesterday that was me. There was no mind control or anything.
Sil and I are the same person.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, you're
going to have to be clearer than that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I really can't
go into details, but have you ever heard of DID?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn paused for a
second as he thought about it. The strange actions, the fluctuations
in voice, it indeed was like he was a different person. Suddenly, a
memory came back to him. There was one time he had met Sil before.
When he was being questioned. Quinn always wondered how Vorden had
gotten away with the lying test back then. He thought he had borrowed
a mind swap ability at the time, but what if that wasn't the case at
all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You mean you
have split personalities?&quot; Quinn said, shocked. He had heard of
things like this before but had never seen anything like this in
person. He also never realized how separate these personalities were.
He always thought if he was to meet someone with DID it would be
similar to a person who had mood swings. But the way Vorden had acted
was almost like two people were living inside one body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't go
into many details about how or why not yet anyway, but I will tell
you one thing. I can copy only one ability. In comparison, the other
one can copy three. That's why I needed to switch with him yesterday
when fighting you.&quot; Vorden explained. Purposely, Vorden avoided
telling Quinn about Raten, having to tell someone this was hard
enough, and he wasn't able to go into details about the whole thing
anyway. So, for now, he would keep it as simple as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, why
didn't you tell us this. I told you about me being a vampire, right?
If you told me, or even the others, we would have understood.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
why I'm telling you this, Quinn? Because I want to regain your trust.
You trusted me, and now I'm trusting you. Vorden then held out his
hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Looking at it,
it reminded Quinn of the first day the two of them had met. He was
the only one that reached out to him; ever since then, the two of
them had been through all out. Then he remembered something else, the
three of them had gone through a lot. There was also Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I trust you,
Vorden,&quot; Quinn said, shaking his hand. &quot;But that doesn't
mean I don't think you make stupid decisions. So, do I get to meet
this guy at some point? Maybe we can be friends?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden laughed but
chose not to say anything back. If Sil had heard this, he would have
been running out from his corner and had taken over the seat in an
instant. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When approaching
Quinn back then, when they had first met, he did so because he was a
level one. Often low levels looked at the world differently due to
how they were treated. But after Sil had gained an interest, it meant
now his life would revolve around Quinn. However, Vorden was happy
that Sil had taken an interest in Quinn. He felt like the two of them
were no real friends. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I also came
here for something else as well,&quot; said Vorden. &quot;I was
hoping to come here before they did, and it looks like I beat them.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They?&quot;
Quinn replied, slightly confused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you
forget? Now that Peter isn't there, that means the substitute will
have to take his place. They should be here soon to take you
underground.&quot; Vorden explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh! I
completely forgot about it; I never thought this would even happen.
Oh, well.&quot; He said, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;I guess I'll
just lose the match.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you really
want to do that, Quinn?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm asking you
again, do you want to lose the match?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, Quinn
didn't. For the longest time, ever since he had gotten his powers, he
wanted to show all those people who thought he was weak, all those
people that bullied him what he could do. And more than ever, He
tried to beat whatever net Truedream had set up for Quinn. All this
mess in the first place was because of him and sick ways. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We can fight.&quot;
Said Vorden. &quot;On the red portal planet, we came up with a plan,
remember. If they discover your powers, then I would tell them that
my family was backing you. We can use that today. Before Fex had
left, he said something. He told us that he and the one who came to
get him were the only vampires on the military bases. That there were
no others.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At the time, I
was wondering why he needed to tell us that. It is always better to
be careful just in case, right? But I think he knew what was going to
happen once Peter was taken. He was telling you to go crazy, not to
worry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Vorden using
his original family name, they would no longer be after Quinn for the
ability book. They would assume it was with Vorden's family. The
other problem was the vampires. Even If they weren't here, there was
always the chance they would find out about him, but did that really
matter anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was only a matter

while on his walk, Quinn had regained all of his health points. As

regenerate on its own. But if it did, it would make it also so he was

single session of restraining himself was. </FONT></FONT>

have to hunt for it himself, which was near impossible or hire
someone else to get the item for him. </FONT></FONT>

there really wasn't much for him to do. Since the first round of
fights had already been completed, the others knew what powers they
had. This meant that the training hall was full of people using their
powers, they would still keep moves hidden, but they were able to
practice a lot better than before. </FONT></FONT>

fighting. </FONT></FONT>

for a good five minutes, and when leaning up against the wall,
another person games to join him. One that was quite wide and large

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two said nothing
to each other as they looked at all the participants. The person who
was also up against the wall was Nate. The whole night, Sam had been
excited after finding out that ZombieP would be in the fighting
event. It was a shame that the Blood evolver didn't turn out to be
Larry, but this had at least am up for it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as soon as
he had entered the room, he looked and looked but couldn't see Peter
anywhere. He stood out more than the others, and he wasn't the only

was the kid who always had two guards beside him, and it also turns
out he had an amazing regenerative ability. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For him to suddenly
disappear, they all could tell straight away. Noticing this, Nate
knew that there had to be a replacement. Wanting to get a better look
at everyone, he decided to look from the wall and look at all the
participants taking part. From the first day, he had kept an eye on
everyone as he went about looking for Larry. There were far fewer
people today, but still, he couldn't see anyone new practising. </FONT></FONT>

slash of air came out through. It was hard to see, but one could feel
it if their senses were sharp enough. Nate, noticing this turned to
his side as he moved, at the same moment, he saw another student that
had been on the wall with him the whole time. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But, Quinn didn't
listen, he too could sense the wind and instead decided to stay
still. Knowing that the attack wasn't going to hit him. The attack
slammed into the wall making a small bang as it hit like the end of
the whip. However, there was no marking on the walls for it was made
of glathrium. </FONT></FONT>

to walk over towards the student. He had overheard the students

standing there by the wall and wanted to give them a little scare. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this
reminded both Burnie and Owen of their encounter with the Blade

it was none of their business. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You are

unfortunately, we won't be seeing ZombieP perform in today's match. I
got a report this morning from the doctor. He can't move; his whole

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then, that

fun at all. The substitute is a substitute for a reason simply
because they weren't good enough to be picked in the first place. If
it happened in the first round, sure, it might have been
entertaining. But the students that are left are quite strong. I
almost feel sorry for the student.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

would allow him to fight the strongest one. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At least the

the Block Block game past level five, and finally, he had an ability
that was hidden from the military. All of these were why Owen was
confident that the one named Cursed Child would win. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Its a bit more
than that,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;The user is able to produce
clones in an instant, as long as he has enough MC cells to do so.
Judging by the number of clones he's already created and how freely
he is producing them. He has a lot.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The clones can
usuelly take a fair bit of damage before puffing into smoke, my guess
is Quinn's attack is a lot stronger then it looks to everyone else.
The problem is, although thier just clones, thier weapons and
everything about them are very real. The attacks will hurt just as
much as if it was done from the original.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Technically
yes, but there's another problem. Judging by his Mc level being a
level 8 and him being in this tournament, he's most likely also
learned his families body swap skill. It allows the user to switch
the real body with one of the clones whenever they wish.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the arena,
two of the five fights had come to an end, and only three of the

this very moment. They could see that the Multiplier was trapped and

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam looked carefully
at the strange power. He had expected Quinn to be hiding something,
he even thought he was a hundred percent sure that he was the Blood
evolver, but this, he had never seen the Blood evolver do this
before. Even if they had learned a new skill, there was a clear
difference between what he was seeing right now. The Blood evolvers
powers produced a red aura, while this was purple and dark; it felt
different. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's sick and
tired of hiding,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;I can feel it, and I
think you guys can too. The whole situation was just frustrating him
more and more as the days went by. Sooner or later this was going to
happen, so might as well do it now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But won't
people come after him after they learn about his background?&quot;
Layla asked. &quot;He was an orphan and the military knew he had no
ability before. The others will try to ask for the ability book, or
try to find out how he learned this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And what
original family do you come from?&quot; Sam asked. If Vorden was
confident to use his family's name to protect a rare ability, they
had to be strong. If they weren't, then others would still try to
attack or pressure them in some way to obtain the ability book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam started to think
hard if he had ever heard such a name before, but he tried and tried.
He was quite knowledgeable and even knew some medium-sized factions
and families, but the Blades just didn't seem to ring a bell.
However, since his family was an original family and managed to stay
that way, it meant it would still give Quinn some protection. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When abilities
started to become more well known around the world and families began
to reveal themselves. Some of the original families were broken up
and had their abilities learned and stolen, eventually making them
known to the public. They then were no longer known as originals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only the more potent
abilities or the ones under the Big three at the time, were able to
keep their abilities and powers to themselves. If Vorden's family was
still considered an original, they had to have some influence, right?

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Opening up a part of
the shadow from the front, the small blades moved again, and Quinn
had blocked them with his gauntlets. He then moved out from where the
shadow was originally placed and allowed for the shadow to return to

wholly missing and falling off the arena. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The small blades

everyone's eyes on the stage and from the booth, Quinn had
disappeared entirely. The stronger ones could still sense where Quinn
was, as this was only a visual effect, an illusion almost, but to the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Multiplier himself
had quite keen senses and could tell Quinn was still here, but found
it hard to pinpoint his exact location. The problem was, Quinn was
just too fast. When attacking, the shadow cloak was disabled, and a

head. The puff of black smoke appeared once more. </FONT></FONT>

right in the position of the next person. Without hesitation, an
uppercut was delivered, and with it, another cloud of smoke appeared.

running up to him. Quickly spinning his body and lifting his leg, he
performed a spinning back kick, hitting Multiplier through the air
and off the arena ground. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was another
problem, sooner or later, his MC points would run out. The weapon the

you did know he had an ability, the Multiplier is one of the
strongest people in this tournament, and that fact still doesn't
change. Besides, we all know how the Multiplier likes to toy with his
opponents from the last fight, and he still hasn't shown everything
he's got. Although, with the Cursed Child, I do wonder what level his
ability is at?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It is a hard
one to judge,&quot; Owen replied. &quot;The ability itself doesn't
seem to have many attacking opportunities. If the user himself wasn't
so skilled in hand to hand combat, then this fight might have been
long over. However, it also seems the ability itself is versatile. It
cloaked him, making him almost invisible, and also, it can be moved
around at will like an elemental power. I have a feeling we haven't
seen everything yet.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back on the
platform, Quinn slowly made his way back into the center. The others
found this quite the amateur move as it allowed him to be surrounded.
If he stood near the outer edge, he was able to face opponents coming
from one direction. Yes, there was a higher chance one would be
knocked off from the stage. But it still gave him better options. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, Quinn knew if
he weren't the aggressor, he would eventually lose this fight. Once
in the center, all the clones threw their small blades again, and
Quinn repeated with the same action lifting the shadow and blocking
the attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can do this
all day, come on!&quot; Quinn shouted, hoping that the Multiplier
would try something new. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of them switched

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, do you
think you've won?&quot; the Multiplier spoke. When speaking, each of
his clones spoke simultaneously, and the voice sounded louder
together like an odd choir. &quot;You do know I've been playing
around with you this whole time. You see, I like to toy with my
opponents, sometimes make them feel like they are winning. Some
matches I start with two, for others, I begin with four. After seeing
how easily you dealt with my clones, I decided on six. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But, I guess
that wasn't enough.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From behind the six
people that surrounded the arena, another six people were seen behind
them as they moved to the side to make twelve. It was the first time
in the tournament the Multiplier had ever used twelve people to fight
so far. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's see how
you deal with this!&quot; the Multiplier said, as all twelve clones
decided to charge in towards the center at the same time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A thick purple
shadow spread out from his feet across the floor in all directions
from where Quinn stood. Once it reached a particular area, it started
to rise, eventually creating a small dome shape. The dome incased
both Quinn and all of the clones with him. From the outside, the
public suddenly couldn't see anything, but a purple dome of moving
shadows. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's going

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are they still

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This had to be
that Cursed Child's ability right.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
starting to feel nervous about our little bet?&quot; Owen asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Although I
don't know what this strange dome thing does, I can not believe one
person could take on twelve. I didn't even know the Multiplier could
copy himself that many times. If I have him in one of my families, it
would be like having a little squad. He would be able to go out on
solo missions on his own.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As time went by and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the shadows
around started to fade away slowly. They began to disappear from the
top of the dome to the bottom and eventually returned to the original
users two feet, where one person could be seen standing, while the

One of the favourites from the first years had been defeated, and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others had, of
course, noticed this as well. For this to have happened, the fight
inside the dome couldn't have been a close one. The dome-shaped

small problem, something he never thought would get in the way, and
that was the bet. Jack was one of the ones that hadn't spoken up when

turn down such an offer from one of the big four. Perhaps there was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even with the void

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, what the
Multiplier also didn't realise was he wasn't the only one who had
been holding back the whole fight. As the multiple clones came
towards him, for a brief second Quinn closed his eyes and started to
think back to the block, block game. The slightest sound, the
slightest movement he was able to see the attacks just as they moved.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Multiplier was
doing near enough the same thing. Using his clones to attack him from
multiple directions, and even though there was twelve of them, there
was only so much space that could be used to attack. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The twelve had come

shoulder, he attacked as soon as he saw the slightest movement and

other. Everything was done at a speed that hadn't been used in the

There wasn't enough time to recover as Quinn's strength was strong
enough to deal with the clones with a single blow. It was something

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had half
expected this, his shadow had the ability to slow down time of
whatever it was touching, and due to how the Multipliers ability
worked right now, it was taking an incredibly long time to even clone
himself. With this, the Multiplier started to panic; he had always
relied on his skills to move from one clone to other. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In his haste, he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These were memories
he would never forget. He was embarrassed and humiliated as the two
students were saved by Pure. There were two people who had interfered
and had gotten in his way. After the events, he had his two guards
file a report. Kenny talked about how a strange user, who seemed to
control a shadow, had fought him. Not only that, there was also the
mention of hands as one of the skills along with other things. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finding out
about this revelation, Jack couldn't believe it. Slowly, it was
starting to make sense of how they knew his every move and how they
could plan against him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Of course, Pure
would have put a Student spy into the school system. Just how they
rescued Peter before, they most likely used him to do the same here
as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'You were always one

you.&quot; Jack said with a smile as he got up from his seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where are you
going, Jack?&quot; Oscar asked. &quot;Are you not going to watch the
rest of the fighting events?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah, there are
some important business matters I need to look into. Don't worry; I
shall be back soon.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack left the room
and started walking at a fast pace out of the booth to head back to
his room. There were still a few things he needed to think about
before he could make his next move. Even if Quinn was a part of Pure,
that didn't change the fact that he had a rare ability that no one
had seen before. Suddenly, claiming the student was part of Pure,
might make it harder for him to obtain the boy's powers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wanted both Pure,
and the shadow power for himself. Quinn was the key to that. Once
Jack had returned to the room, he had contacted his headquarters back
at Dreamland City. A digital display on his wall, connecting a video
call. Immediately he had called for his old Guard Kenny, who had made
the report about the shadow powers before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's right,
sir, everything you said matches up with exactly what I saw that
day,&quot; Kenny replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, another
message had appeared on screen, which was from sergeant Duke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'The information
about the student I requested.' Quickly he started to read through
the report. 'Quinn Talen… only child… Orphan, pfft the perfect
backstory for an agent of Pure. No surprise there.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Jack was busy
talking about his team and doing research on Quinn, over at the
arena, the reporter had just finished talking with Multiplier.. She
was now moving on to the star of the show, Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First, I have
to congratulate you on your upset victory. Of course, we all saw your
impressive martial arts skill when fighting the clones but what we
really want to know about is your ability. My research says that
you're not from an original family. Still, I don't think any of us
here have ever seen an ability like that before. So what we want to
know is just how and what ability is that?&quot; The reporter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
big screen, and he could see his own face maximized for everyone to
see. Everyone in the crowd was waiting for his answer. He then
thought back to what Vorden had said, and he was ready to reply. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you said, I
am not from an original family. I grew up as an orphan. The detail of
how I learned the ability is a story and a half, so bear with me. An
incident happened at school a while back, where I was transported to
a red portal planet. The whole place seemed abandoned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;While I was
there, I came across an ability book I had never seen before. I
currently didn't have an ability, and I thought my luck had finally
changed. The school eventually found me and returned me safely, but I
chose to keep the fact I had found the book a secret. This event had
happened a few months back. Due to it being a high-level ability
book, it took me a long time to learn. Even after learning it, with
no teacher or reference on how to use the ability, it took a while to
come up with my own skills. I wasn't ready and chose to hide this
from everybody. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As an orphan
and no family or factions to protect me, this felt like the right
thing to do. However, today a good friend of mine had offered in
return for giving them the ability book, I would become a member of
their faction and family. As for the ability itself and which family
that is, I think you will all understand why I won't go into further
details about that now, as it's not fair to the original family who
took me in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Before I end
this interview, I have one last thing to say.&quot; Once again, Quinn
looked up above the arena, where his friends and Vorden would be
standing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you chose
to still go after me, then the chains that have been locked away for
centuries shall be broken by the Blades.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were many
questions the reporter had wanted to ask, but Quinn had already
started walking away after saying those few words. After hearing
Quinn's story, the people in the crowd could understand the reasoning
of what had happened so far and why the student had chosen to do what
he had done. However, the families and factions in the crowds felt
like what the student had just done, was outright silly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if he didn't
reveal the family's name that was protecting the book, they would
find out soon. Declaring that this family had the ability book was
putting a target on their back, and unless they were one of the big
four, there was unlikely anything that would stop them from trying to
take it from this family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the
reaction in the booth was a completely different one. The last words
had sent a shiver down each of the Big Three in the room's spine.
Goosebumps were felt all over the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Damn!' Owen shouted
in his head. For the first time, he wasn't so giggly cheery like his
usual self. Instead, he was biting his fingernails. 'I knew this was
a possibility after I saw the two of them were friends. But who would
have thought? Now no one can touch him.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Those last lines.'
Mona thought. 'They were quite clearly a code, a code that only we
would know.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Oscar had noticed a
slight change in the room. Usually, they were quite a rowdy bunch,
especially with Burnie and Owen always bickering at each other, but
now there was complete silence. 'Was it something the boy said?' He
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he was concerned
with a different matter. If what the student was saying was true, the
red portal he had access to must have come from the military base
they were at. Which meant it was a planet the military had explored.
Why was there such an ability book on a planet like that? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Oscar wished to
delve further once this whole event was over. Perhaps he would find
clues about the ability book and what had happened on the red portal
planet. It might even lead him to the original owners of the ability
book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The rest of the
event continued as usual, and Jack had eventually returned with a
smile on his face. The event had now been going on for a while, and
during it, not a word was spoken. They hadn't really focused on the
matches at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each one of thems'
minds was filled with other matters, and finally, the event had come
to an end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The big four
returned to their rooms, and so did the supreme commander. As Jack
went back, he started to think of a plan he could put in place. If he
was only to inform the military of the matter without the others
knowing, then maybe they would allow him to take the boy's ability.
It would also make sure the power didn't fall into the other three's
hands, and he knew they would like that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, it was a
little risky. The best time to do anything would be when the boy
returned to his military base. Pure still didn't know he knew about
him. He had close connections with Duke and could use this to catch
Quinn and take his powers before anyone could interfere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Going to his desk,
he grabbed a bottle of whisky that was out on display and poured
himself a clean, nice shot with no ice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I deserve this for
everything I've done today.' Jack said as he lifted the glass in the
air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, he heard a
knock at the door. A frustrated Jack placed the glass back on the
table and answered it. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is it!&quot;

meeting between the Leaders though. Mona had specifically told him
that this was a meeting for only the big four families, which meant
it didn't include the head generals or the supreme commander. As if
it was something they didn't want them to know about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was a rare
matter, and the only time Jack had been called into a meeting like
this before, was when they decided to invite him to join the leader's
table. Making the Big three into the big Four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, Mona had
led him down the hallway, and they stopped just outside The Sundhiled
family room. When she pushed the heavy door open, the other two could
already be seen sitting there waiting. The rooms they stayed in were
quite grand and large, and there were several separate rooms. Each
one was designed slightly different to suit there own style. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack looked around
the room, even though it was the same layout, it looked completely
different when comparing it to his own. Most of the decor used looked
like it was from an older era. There were also several paintings of
large beasts on the wall with a single man taking it down. 'Useless
Junk' As Jack would have called it was scattered on top of desks and
drawers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nonetheless, Jack
needed to comply, so he sat down at the large rounded table that
looked like it was designed for twenty, but only the four of them
were present. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This, of course,
meant they were sitting quite far away from each other, but Jack
liked this anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As the elder
of the group I shall be the one to start the meeting,&quot; Mona
said. Although she didn't look old at all. Burnie looked to be in his
fifties, and Jack was just reaching his thirties. Jack had always
thought Mona was around the same age as him, but now she had suddenly
declared that she was older. He was wondering what type of witchcraft
she had to use to look so young. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that he thought
about, she certainly dressed like a witch as well. Even now in the
middle of the night, she was dressed in all black, with a pointy hat
and a veil covering her face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Does the mad women
sleep in that?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She stood up from
her seat as she talked to the others. &quot;I'm sure you all know why
I thought it was necessary to call this meeting, but I did so just to
make sure we're all on the same page.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Huh, they know what
this is about already. Have they been doing things without me behind
my back?&quot; Jack thought. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We need to
make sure that all our families and fractions, including the
subfamilies, receive this message. They are prohibited no matter
what, to either go after the student known as Quinn Talen or try to
research which family he has given the ability book to.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What did you
say?&quot; Jack shouted as he shot up from his seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah, I guess
you weren't here for that part,&quot; Owen replied. &quot;I seem to
remember you left the room at that time. The boy who won the match
against the Multiplier. Turns out he and his unique ability is under
the protection of the Blade family.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes,&quot;
Burnie said, nodding his head up and down with his arms crossed on
top of his large belly. &quot;We all heard it, 'the chains that have
been locked away for centuries, shall be broken by the Blades.' And
we all understand what he meant by that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other three all
nodded their head, but Jack didn't have a clue. He didn't have a
grand history of ability users from the beginning of time. His family
and his power were only discovered after the Dalki era. He knew
nothing of what this damned code meant, and he was starting to get
increasingly frustrated that no one was informing him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What he did
understand was what that made clear. They were ordering nearly every
person they could, to not touch Quinn Talen. All of this was due to
his connection with the Blade family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And he wasn't an
exception to this rule most likely. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'My plans, they've

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He needed to do
something. If he wanted to get that mysterious ability. Now the
others would have people keeping a careful eye on him in the military
base whenever they could. It would be impossible for him, even with
his connections to do much without them finding out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't want to do
it, but this was the only thing he could do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn can't be
related to the Blades,&quot; Jack said. &quot;Because I'm sure he's
with Pure.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a brief
moment of silence between the other three until they all started
laughing together shortly after. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's
impossible, Pure and the Blades are black and white. They would never
see eye to eye in the current world.&quot; Mona replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But I'm
telling you the truth. If you don't believe me, I'll bring Quinn here
right now and force a confession out of him!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;ENOUGH!&quot;
Burnie said as he slammed his fist on the table. &quot;Did you not
hear what we just said? No one is to go after the boy, and that
includes you, Jack. We don't agree on a lot of things, Jack...&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You can say
that again,&quot; Owen mumbled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, Burnie
looked over at Owen out of the corner of his eyes, before shaking his
head and continuing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But we all
agree on this. If you try to lay a finger on that boy, we will do
everything in our power to stop you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Who were these
Blades to be able to cause such fear and unity between these three
powerful forces, yet at the same time seemed to have no power when it
came to the things like the military it just didn't make any sense. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine,&quot;
Jack said, sitting back down in his seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the
meeting was quickly over. Although they didn't finish it before
reminding Jack once again, that the military was to know nothing
about this and to warn him about not going after the boy. His hands
were tied. If it was just one of the big families telling him to not
go after the boy, then he would risk a confrontation, but all three
together? His family wasn't strong enough and would never come out
alive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack was confident
in his family's strength. Over time he had gathered strong abilities
and men by his side and the unique thing about his family. Their
abilities were all versatile, while the others only had a single
powerful ability. In a way in his own head, Jack had deemed his own
family as the strongest power force currently. Even ahead of the
military, but it wasn't enough to start a fight over, especially with
the Dalki watching their moves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, thinking
about his family's strength made him think about something else. They
were all clearly scared of the Blades. They repeatedly told him not
to go after Quinn. What that didn't stop him from doing was going
after the Blades. If he got rid of them, he would naturally take
their seat of power. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others were
clearly afraid of something that happened in the past, but they
didn't know Jack's full strength either. He would much rather fight
one family then three strong ones, and he would also get whatever
Power the Blades have as well as the shadow power. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the one plus
side of Jack's ability. Whatever family he would defeat, essentially
their powers would be added to his even if they refused to join,
because he could take it from them with force. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Quinn's
match had ended, he decided to go straight to his room, avoiding
talking with any of the other participants or remaining in the

reached level 30, he could then start to focus on his other skills.
Charm was handy in helping Quinn keep his secrets, but soon he would
have no secrets to keep and the ones that would be after him next,
were the vampires. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According to the
system AI, the number of points and strength one would have to have
in their Charm to control another vampire would be enormous. Using
the skills themselves, they naturally had some type of resistance to
it. So Quinn needed to focus on getting stronger for what was about
to come later. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Quinn was
looking at most, was the updated quest. There was only one more level
until he would evolve into the next step. Would this mean a new
appearance, a new set of blood skills? Or, would it just mean a new
set of problems to deal with? </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With these thoughts
in his head, he didn't remember when he had finally closed his eyes
and fallen asleep. He was far more tired then he realised. All of a

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Ergh, why do people

the time on his watch, and he could see that it was already the next
day in the early morning. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

the whole night, When?' </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When rubbing his
eyes, and trying to move his quilt, he happened to spot something
small on his left hand where his wristwatch was—a small metallic
little spider. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This is Logan's
spider, right? What's it doing here?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn Talen,
this is military personnel. Please open your door and let us in.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;One second
please, let me just put on some clothes!&quot; Quinn shouted back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The spider quickly
ran up to Quinn's ear and started to play a message. While this was
all happening Quinn promptly got dressed into the standard military
uniform. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, this is
Logan. I kept this spider near you in case you needed a little help.
My guess is the military might want to check the level gauge on your
watch. Don't worry. My little friend here has already made the
adjustments.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The spider lifted

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Make sure to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Putting his trust
into Logan, and not really knowing what was going on, he opened the
door to find Hayley outside and what looked like one of the soldiers
standing by her side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's been a
long time,&quot; Hayley said, as she entered the room and placed a
suitcase out on the table. &quot;This isn't usually my thing, but
they asked me to do this, but before that, congratulations. When I
saw you, I knew you were impressive, and don't worry; with all the
injuries I see at happen at the school. I think you did nothing
wrong, hiding your powers.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She sat down in the
seat by the desk, and the soldier carefully Led Quinn over to her,
keeping an eye on everything he was doing. Watching in case, Quinn
tried to pull anything. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley proceeded to
open the metal case and inside it, was what looked like a brand new
military watch. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now I have to
ask you not to touch anything,&quot; Hayley explained. &quot;I will
take off the old watch and also place the new one on.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn nodded in
response and went along with it. Even if Logan had said not to worry,
right now Quinn was worrying. When they had put the watch on, what
would happen when it didn't record his MC cells. Would they find out
he wasn't human, or would they then take him in for further
questioning? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The watch had been
taken off and placed on the table. At the same time, she picked up
the new one from the suitcase and wrapped it around Quinn's wrist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The watch seemed to
be turning on slowly and at the same time while underneath his wrist,
the little spider started to get to work. Hayley remained silent and
so did Quinn as they both carefully waited for a result. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a few moments,
the watch finished booting up, and the display had changed. It went
from Level One to a Level six. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Well, that makes a
lot of sense.&quot; She said with a smile on her face. &quot;I was a
little worried it would say one their for a second. Do you know why
the watch didn't display the correct level even after learning the
ability?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I just
decided to go with it, since I thought it was better this way,&quot;
Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not a
problem,&quot; Hayley said with a smile as she put the broken watch
in the suitcase and left with the guard. Before closing the door, she
had one last word to say. &quot;Good luck on the tournament. I'm
rooting for you, Cursed child.&quot; She said as she giggled and shut
the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His face had gone
bright red with embarrassment. After hearing a pretty lady like that
say his stage name, he now realised how lame it sounded, and he just
wanted to make a hole and put his head in it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, thanks to
Logan again, it seemed like he could relax. His vision to look and
plan ahead for things had saved him many times. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not wanting the
attention of the others outside. Instead of training like everyone
else was doing. He decided to wait in his room until he was called
for the next event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike Peter, Quinn
wasn't treated like a criminal and was able to stay in contact with
the others above using the wristwatch and other methods. They told
him what was going on with the events and such, but not much else had
happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The time had come,
and an announcement had been made, stating that the participants of
the fighting tournament would now be placed in their groups. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leaving the room,
everything was different this time when he entered the practice hall.
It was the third day of the event, and there were even fewer people
now than before. Not only that, every single person there seemed to
be looking at him, and this included the second years. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ignoring everything,
Quinn decided to stay at the back of the whole group where the
students had gathered, as the organisers called out their names. This
way, he knew no one would be able to look at him from behind.
However, he quickly realised how useless this was, as now everyone
seemed to be turning their head slightly to the side, trying to look
back at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, and for

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;YES!&quot;
Nate shouted as his name was called out. The others looked at him
wondering what he was so excited for, but only he knew. For days he
had been hoping to face a half-decent opponent, but so far he had
only been disappointed. After seeing the Cursed Child be put in the
same group as him, he was sure his luck had now changed for good. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate looked at his

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Nate's
heart started to beat. There was an odd amount of people. This often
happened due to the number of participants taking part in the
tournament. However, more often than not, a few people would drop
out, or even a double knockout in cases, this would eventually even
up the numbers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If they had enough
people, they wouldn't even bother calling up the substitute since it
would just complicate matters. Right now, in the fighting tournament,
there must have been an odd amount of people, and when this happens,
it means only one thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright.&quot;
The soldier said, holding something behind his back the others
couldn't quite see. &quot;As you can see, group C is filled with
seven people rather than six or eight, which means one of you won't
be fighting today and will be able to move on to the next round,
lucky you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it,&quot;
Nate said, stomping the floor. &quot;Damn it, why this group why,
why!&quot; He cried. To the others, this would be a blessing, but to
Nate, it's seemed like another obstacle trying to get in his way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The soldier waited
until Nate calmed down until proceeding further. He then revealed
what he was hiding behind his back, and it was seven small sticks
held in his hand with the bottom part covered up. &quot;One of these

free from this round. Let's see..&quot; He said as he scanned the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn casually
walked up to the front. There was no use trying to figure out which
one was the red one, so he just picked the one closest to him. The
stick was completely clear when pulling out, and there wasn't a red

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes!&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now Quinn was
starting to realize how much Nate wanted to fight him. However, this
wasn't like the others, who tried to fight him because he was weak or
to try to show off their own skills. It was because Nate thought he
was strong. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking about this
made him feel a little warm inside. It was a change and a feeling he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was happy about
this; it meant his fate was going to be in his hands, not of

Nate said as he opened his eyes and turned his head, only to see that
the soldier was no longer standing in front of him and was standing
next to the other student instead. When looking at his stick, he
noticed it was completely clear. There was no marking at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There wasn't time to
celebrate for Nate, as the soldier was already leading them all onto
the arena floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I knew the world
wanted me and you to fight.' Nate thought. 'This was just another
sign that nothing was going to get in our way.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they exited from
the underground tunnel and onto the floor, the cheers were there as
usual, and the others were watching above on the large screen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, this will
be interesting.&quot; Said Sam, seeing the screen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean by that?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, the
reason I've been keeping a close eye on the event so far is that my
close friend is in it, and it looks like Quinn, and he is in the same
group,&quot; Sam replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Friend,
judging by how you were hanging around us all the time. I would have
assumed you had no friends.&quot; Logan replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That comment had
stung Sam in the heart a bit, but he couldn't deny the fact that if
others did know he was hanging around with a bunch of first-years
from another base. It really would look like he had no friends. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is your friend
strong?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You better
believe it.&quot; Said Sam.&quot; Although he's only a Level seven in
terms of ability power, you can tell how strong he is based on how he
was able to make it this far.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I look forward
to seeing him fight then,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, let's
just hope your friend and Quinn don't get put together. Otherwise, it
would be pretty awkward.&quot; Said Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I would
feel bad supporting my friend right next to you guys, but as far as I
know about Nate, he would be begging to be put up against Quinn.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And that was exactly
what Nate was doing. The whole way, as he walked, he had his hands
held together, and his eyes closed. He would only rely on his hearing
to follow the footsteps in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then finally, they
came to a halt. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, Quinn
Tallen stage three and Nate Snell.&quot; The soldier said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He couldn't believe
it, his prayers were answered, and he was finally going to fight
someone worthwhile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two got into
position and waited for the announcers to call all of the names. This
time there were only three platforms, and once again, they had
increased in size. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And finally,
on the third platform, we have the unexpected winner from last round,
The Cursed Child! And his opponent for today who always seems to
manage to pull a win out of the bag, Hardsteely.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The earth user
raised the two onto the platform, but Quinn was struck with something
after hearing the name. It was about the stage name that had been
used. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had instantly
recognized it because it was the first friend he had ever added on
the Power fighters VR game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'These two are the
same person.' Quinn was very thankful to Nate. He had given him
advice before the portal planet and also taught him a great lesson
when it came to fighting. If he ever met this person in real life,
Quinn wanted to thank him for his help. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He never thought he
would be meeting a person he met through a game this way right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the two walked
onto the large fighting area, the happiness on Nate's face could be
seen a mile away, and the camera right now was focused on him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The comments about
him weren't nice as always, but he didn't care if he was happy he
would show it, if he was sad, he would show it. Unlike the others, he
wouldn't be fake and would just be himself. What was the point of
pretending to be something you weren't? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's get this
fight started; show me that purple shadow of yours,&quot; Nate said,
punching his fist into his other hand. Each time this was done, a
loud clanging sound was heard as if metal was clashing against metal.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn smiled at Nate
and then raised his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I forfeit from
the fight.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The referee, who was
slightly off the side and just outside the arena, was surprised at
this; he looked at Quinn for confirmation only to hear him repeat it.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I forfeit from
the fight. He is your winner.&quot; Quinn repeated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No!&quot; Nate
said. &quot;Why are you doing this to me? Why are you refusing to
fight me? Is it because you don't think I'm strong enough? Come on.
I'll show you right now!&quot; He shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn
couldn't tell Nate the real reason. Quinn knew he was plenty strong,
perhaps one of the strongest people he had met before. When the fight
had started, he had received a quest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[A strong opponent
has appeared. Defeat the opponent in front of you to receive an
instant level up.] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the reason
why Quinn decided not to continue the fight. Whether he would win or
not only using his shadow abilities was another story but what he
didn't want to do was evolve in front of everybody. If he were to win
the fight, the process would start immediately, and not knowing its
result was too much of a risk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could have always
fought and then allowed Nate to win at the end but judging from how
they fought before, Nate wouldn't have liked that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I refuse.
I don't care. I'm fighting, you know, and you better start throwing
back!&quot; Nate said as he walked his way across the arena and
towards Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the referee had
come in between the two of them, stopping Nate midway. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The contestant
has already forfeited. This match is over.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The audience
watching was all confused at what was happening as they were unable
to hear the conversation going on. Then the announcement was made. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hardsteely has

by what had just happened, and so were the others in the booth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But they couldn't be
for long, as two more interesting fights were happening by the side
and their attention quickly focused on them instead. They could worry
about why the other chose to drop out later. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please!&quot;

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I never said I
wouldn't fight you,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;We don't have to fight
here; if you really want to fight me, we can do it when this event is
over through the game Power fighters.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

wanted to do was have a good fight. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Quinn having
forfeited from the fighting event, he was now free to return to the
hotel with the others for the night and have rest for the remaining
week. It had been a rollercoaster ride of events, but still, not
everything was over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the other
matches had ended, the reporter wanted to interview him, asking him
why he had decided to forfeit his match? However, by the time the
other fights were finished, they quickly realized that instead of
staying to watch the other fights, Quinn had left to return to his
room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most of the audience
understood and started to theorize their own reasons for his forfeit.
Either too much power was used in the fight yesterday, and there
hadn't been enough time to recover, or there was still more to his
ability that the student didn't want to show; after all, it was
practically a new ability in the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The more he fought
in front of thousands and thousands of people, the higher the chance
the people around could figure it out. Of course, the Big Four didn't
have any questions, and Oscar was far more interested in the planet
that Quinn had gotten the power from in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While in his room on
his own, he still couldn't stop thinking about Peter. It felt cruel
in a way that he was just taken. They would never find out his fate
or if he was okay. Yet somehow, he was meant to just accept the
result. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But there was truly
nothing he could do about it. The AI system had no clue where the
current Vampires lived. With no way to get there, it was pointless to
think of a way to save him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A return portal. The
only problem was Logan still hadn't managed to crack the code. Past
even that, though, what could Quinn even do when he got there? He was
still weak. Fex was considered a young vampire, and there were bound
to be even more powerful vampires there. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Again there was no

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day, Quinn
had joined up with his friends to watch the event. There were only
two days left now before everything would come to an end. Meeting up
with everyone, the group seemed smaller than before. With Fex and
Peter gone, it felt kind of quiet since they were the most talkative
bunch in the group. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Sam there
joining them to watch the events, the group decided they would
support Nate. Quinn was secretly rooting for him, but something
seemed to be off during his match. As if his mind was somewhere else.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, this was
the semifinals. The second last day. His opponent wasn't taking it
easy and instantly revealed his soul weapon. The first-year students
watching were now keeping a close eye; for some of them, it was their

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The final day of the
event had arrived and when Sam had met up with the group, he had
brought along a little friend with him. Nate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You, you...
You know this guy, Sam?&quot; Nate said, pointing at the Cursed
Child. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ha, ha, it's a
long story. Why don't why just sit down, and I'll tell you all about
it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They watched the
final day of events and continued to talk, laugh, and tell stories to
each other. Nate and Sam seemed to have even known each other before
coming to military school, which was a little rare since the
organizers tried to purposely split people who did know each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But because of this,
they had plenty of embarrassing stories to tell. When they were done
speaking about theirs, they asked about the others starting with
Quinn. He explained how his parents died in the war and the mood
suddenly had gotten somber. Moving on to Vorden, it seemed he kept
avoiding the question completely, and so did Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The atmosphere
suddenly got a little awkward. It felt as if Nate and Sam were very
open about everything, while the others were still hiding. Still,
they decided to ignore it since everyone was having a good time
before this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what about
you, Logan?&quot; Sam asked. &quot;What did you do before coming
here?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not much. I
didn't talk to people at my last school as I like to stay alone,
started a few gaming projects, and was the same at this school. That
is until I met Quinn. Ever since my life seems to have been busier
than ever but not in a bad way.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on,&quot;
Layla said. &quot;He's not giving himself enough credit. Those few
projects he started in school turned out to be a big deal.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Sam asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Those projects
are still ongoing today. Although you guys might know them as the
game, Power fighters.&quot; Logan answered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What!&quot;
Nate said, suddenly interested. The two of them were enthusiasts for
the game, and right now, they were sitting with the inventor. They
weren't even aware that a kid created it since his family's name who
owned the company was attached to it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!.&quot;
said Nate. &quot;That means you must know about the Blood Evolver
right? Do you know who he is? Is he really hacking the system?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course, I
know who he is,&quot; Logan replied with honesty. &quot;But for
privacy reasons, I can not reveal that to you. However, I can tell
you that he has not hacked the site. The ability being used is a
strange one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The conversation
between the group continued, mostly with Nate trying to figure out
some way for Logan to tell him who the Blood Evolver was, and soon,
the last event of the whole week was announced. The grand finale of
the fighting event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group wanted to
pay attention to the fight, and so did Quinn. These were the
strongest two students out of all seven of the military bases. Due to
them being second years, they would be leaving after the end of this
year. So there was a good chance Quinn would never see them again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, that might
not be the case once they left the military. Outside it was a free
world, and there was a chance they could run into anybody again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second reason
was due to the soul weapons that would be used. Quinn had a high
interest in soul weapons as they seemed to increase one's power
significantly. It is said that when one is born, the soul weapon
already starts to form based on their traits and personality.
Eventually, it will get slightly altered when learning their first
ability and will continue to grow from there. Finally, when they are
ready, they would be able to manifest one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The thing was, Quinn
was unsure if Vampires even had soul weapons. Fex didn't seem to have
one; otherwise, he would have used it against the King Tier beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Maybe unlike humans
Vampires when born didn't have a soul weapon inside? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But what about him?
Quinn was born a human and only later turned into a vampire. And if
he did have one, Quinn was starting to wonder what it would be? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The final fight was
set to start. The rules were the same as previous rounds with slight
changes here and there. The platform they would be fighting in was

match, there would be no loss if a participant was knocked out off
the stage. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In this match, there
were also a total of four refs. However, most of their jobs consisted
of staying by the outer ring of the arena. If the students looked

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two in the
finals were second-year students from other military schools, so
Quinn hadn't seen them before apart from the matches from the event.
The first he had seen a little bit off was when the level 8 earth

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The action started
almost immediately, with both revealing their trump cards instantly.
There was no use trying to hide it or find out how the other would

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Graylash student
lifted his hand in the air, and from the palm of his hand, a blue
lightning bolt struck through the air. A few moments later, and the
lighting seemed to strike back down, hitting the student directly. A
large flash of light was seen, causing most of the audience members
to close their eyes. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they opened

hair was now standing upright, his clothes even seemed to be pulled

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the same time,
the Earth user had released his soul weapon. He brought his hands
close together and closed his eyes. Suddenly from his fingertips, a
white glowing light started to appear and began to form a shape. It
had a long handle and a stone head on top. The appearance was that of
a hammer. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On display were two
different types of soul weapons. The earth user's weapon was a
physical one and was most likely going to be used more than just an
ordinary hammer. The Graylash family student had a unique trait. An
energy that powered his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Wasting no time, the
earth user used the ground to propel him towards the student. It
looked as if he was surfing on top of an ocean of mud, when he
finally got close enough. He jumped off the mound of mud and raised
his hammer. Suddenly, it looked as if it was growing in size. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A giant hammer, the
size of a house, was created and was slammed down onto the ground.
When lifting the hammer, it shrunk back down to its normal size. </FONT></FONT>

both hands, he started to create a continuous stream of lighting,
connecting both him and the user. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he finished, the
shutters of the hotel lobby started to come down. Metal doors blocked
the entrance way, and soon every small little hole was now closed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking around, all
the soldiers and school staff were now wearing their gas masks, and
slowly the room started to fill with gas again </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Oh well, time to

him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once all the
students had been knocked out, the shutters were lifted, and a portal
from outside was brought in. While awake, though, Quinn could hear a
strange conversation going on. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do I owe
the pleasure of such a humble visit from you four?&quot; Mike said as
he walked over to the entrance of the hotel. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside, walking into
the lobby, were all members of the Big Four. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about us,&quot; Burnie said. &quot;We are here just to see that all
the students are transported back safely.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a little
strange. Right now, every hotel was doing the same thing with their
set of students. So what had made the big four come over to this
hotel specifically? Mike thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason for their
visit was Quinn. They were here to make sure nobody tried to do
anything to him during the transportation process, and they had even
dragged Jack to come with them. </FONT></FONT>

him.' Jack thought. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack could now see,
they truly would do anything to protect Quinn. Which meant he would
be able to do nothing while he was at the second military base. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using a portable

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone had safely
made it back to military school in one piece. On the night of their
arrival, there wasn't much to do. The event had ended on a Friday
evening, so by the time they had woken up again from the special gas.
It was near enough already the end of the day. The students were told
to head back to their rooms and unpack their belongings. There wasn't
much that they took with them so it wouldn't take long to sort
themselves out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When returning to
his room, Quinn had a sense or an unexpected feeling of being home.
He never really had a place to call his. Since he was a kid, he would
often move from place to place every time he went to a new school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no one to go
back to or at a permanent base, there was never that home sweet home
feeling. For the first time, he had it when he entered his room with
Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a quick night
for the boys. As soon as they finished unpacking they had gone to
sleep. But Layla had a lot of work to do. From the event, she had
been informed that Cia was an agent of Pure. This most likely meant
that Cia also had a variety of tools that had been given to her that
were hidden in the room. If they weren't in the room then there would
be somewhere else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thankfully, it
seemed like Cia was still being looked after by the doctors for a few
days before allowing her to return to her room. This would give Layla
a head start of clearing everything she could find. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Upon returning to
her room, she searched and searched. This time looking harder than
before. When she first arrived, she had done a quick sweep, looking
for cameras and microphones but found none. But she had never
suspected her classmates to also be spying on her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a deep search
and going through Cia's belongings, there were several things found,
including a communication ball. The same as Layla had. It was
continually flashing blue showing that there were messages left
behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Should I just
destroy it and forget about everything.' She said, looking at it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She lifted her hand
and placed it just a little over the ball. Ready to use her powers to
rip it apart. But then, placed it down by her side again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'No, I can't destroy
it, not yet. There's one more person I need to get out of there...
Erin.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Layla had
now cut ties with Pure, she had sent her closest friend at the time
over to their side. Perhaps at some point, the communication device
would come in handy. She no longer had hers and destroyed it in
haste. At the time she acted on emotion rather than thinking things
through, but now she had the time to think. It would be best to keep
it for now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Erin, I promise I
will come to get you one day.' </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was now the
weekend. Students were exempt from lessons for the next two days and
would start their schedule as normal for the final term. After that,
there would be a short summer break for the students where they were
able to go home and see their family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn
didn't know what he would do during that time, it was still a little
far ahead for him to be thinking about it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, you got
anything special planned for these two days?&quot; Vorden asked as he
laid down in his bed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not really, I
think I might just check up on everyone to see how they're doing,
then head to the VR centre later on,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, you were
serious about facing Nate in a Powerfighter match. How are you going
to explain to him about the red aura and the shadow ability?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I won't.&quot;
Said Quinn. &quot;More than anything he just wants a fight. Even if
he knows who I am it will be impossible to prove and it doesn't make
any sense. The only person it would make sense to is him. Besides, I
have Logan. Say worst comes to worst and an investigation does take
place, Logan can just say I'm not the blood evolver and state that
he's at another base. Not that I think it will come to that anyway.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You really
depend on Logan a little too much,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, don't
forget about what you all did. I think you guys owe me at least this
much after going behind my back.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you trying
to blackmail us, not cool man, not cool.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
started to laugh as they knew they were just having a jab at each
other, and with that, Quinn decided to head off to Logan's room.
However, he hadn't been completely truthful to Vorden, he didn't want
to check up on the others but more specifically he wanted to just
check up on Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A single knock was
placed on the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And Quinn entered
the room. The place this time looked a little different compared to
before. The research he had done about the school's underground
dungeons had moved to this room instead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
still think that information is useful?&quot; Quinn asked. &quot;You
know, now that Peter not there anymore.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's always
handy to keep data,&quot; Logan explained. &quot;You never know when
we could use it for future events. Perhaps one day, you, me, or the
others will be placed there. I hope if I get trapped there, you could
use the information to try to break me free as well. So what brings
you here?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Logan was
giving his reply, Quinn continued to look around the room, but the
last question had caught him slightly off guard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who said I
wasn't here just to see if you were okay?&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, I've
known you for a while now and there seems to be a pattern. If you
come to me in the afternoon, as long as there's not an urgent
problem, then you are usually there to check up on me and see how I'm
doing.&quot;Logan explained. &quot;But if you come in the early
morning, usually it's because you have a question or a task for me to
do.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn felt a little
awkward and guilty now. It was fine when checking up on someone to
then ask for a favour or snoop around, but now it felt like the only
reason he had come here was to ask Logan for something. Even worse,
it was true and he realized it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually, I
don't have anything to ask this time or not a favour at least, I
wanted to see how you were doing with that strange square device from
before,&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan, using his two
small legs, pushed his feet and rolled across the room with his chair
to the other side. On this side of the room, one of the computers out
of the many was attached up with wires leading to the strange device.
On the screen, different combinations continued to appear, and each
time it would flash red it would move onto the next one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's taking a
little longer than I thought,&quot; Logan said. &quot;But the good
thing is it will definitely unlock eventually, I just have no clue
when.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is there any
way of finding out where it goes once it's unlocked?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not really,
other than going through ourselves, but who knows if we can come
back. We would have to take a portable portal device with us just in
case.&quot; Logan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, you're
really going to go through there,&quot; Quinn asked, worried for
logan. &quot;Well, if you can please, let me know when the machine
unlocks. I don't want you to go there by yourself, bring me along,
you can think of me as your bodyguard.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not a kid,
I can do these things by myself,&quot; Logan replied, seeming to be
annoyed at Quinn's suggestion. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry, you
know I didn't mean it like that, just I'm really interested just like
you. My system was the one that told me it was made by Richard Eno,
and there might be a chance this leads to his base or something. If
so, maybe he would be able to help us in finding out what this system
is.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Placing his hand on
his chin, Logan started to think about it. It was true that with the
help of Eno, it might be a lot easier, but Logan wanted to discover
things about Quinn's system on his own. However, there was one
possibility, Logan never ruled it out in the first place. Eno was a
person who always seemed to be ahead of everyone else when it came to
technological advances; there could even be a chance he had something
to do with creating the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, I'll
let you know when It gets unlocked.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With all formalities
said and done, Logan got back to working on more gadgets. After the
fight with the king tier and feeling a little weak. He wanted to
create some new items for himself. There was always the chance more

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next stop for
Quinn was to head to the VR room. He had promised Nate he would do
battle with him and he wanted to keep his word. Even if Nate wasn't
online yet, Quinn had the chance to play a couple more games. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When walking through
the hallway, there was a familiar face that he didn't expect to meet.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, Quinn.
It's been a while since me and you were able to talk.&quot; Leo said.
&quot;Do you mind meeting me in the martial arts hall? I have some
important news to tell you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no rush
for Quinn to play the game. After all, there was no confirmed time,
or set time the two would meet. If the two happened to be online he
would send an invite. So Nate could wait for now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sure, why
don't we head there together?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During the walk to
the martial arts hall, it was quite silent between the two. Quinn
always found it hard to read Leo, but at the same time, he trusted
him. It was a good thing he did as well, for he had helped out big
time during the events with Peter. It was because of people like him,
that Quinn hadn't completely given up on hope for humanity. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was at
the moment. There seemed to be two bad people for every one good
person he would meet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had eventually
arrived in the marital hall and it felt large and empty without any
of the students inside. The weapons were still on the wall, and it
reminded Quinn of his first day here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo headed to the
back of the room and sat up against the back wall crossing his legs.
Quinn then followed and did the same sitting opposite him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, I

backwards and fourth but was always going to do at one point. I will

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A metallic fist
pounded onto the poor students' face, and at the same time, 'The
Winner', appeared written in big, bold letters, now floated above his
head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is
starting to get a little boring,&quot; Nate said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He opened up the
game screen and started to scroll down through his friend's list.
There weren't many on the list, as he would often only send out a
request to those he had found interesting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Damn it, who is
he?' Nate said in anger. 'I sent everyone who was online on my
friends list a fighting request, and it turns out he's not a single
one of them. Even worse, I can't even remember why I added half these
people in the first place.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being with Nate and
having watched his last few matches it looked like Nate had gotten
stronger again, very strong. It was a shame if this fight was to
happen, only he would be able to see it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Calm down,&quot;
Sam said. &quot;Maybe he's not like us. Not everyone plays the game
this much. Even if he said he would send you an invite, he didn't say
when.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, Sam
had actually put nearly everything together and had made a guess at
who the Cursed Child was. Although their powers weren't the same, it
was the only thing he could think of, hearing what he had said at the
end of the match. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had only come up
with this theory after finding out that Logan was the creator of the
game. Perhaps when Quinn had made that shadow dome, he started to
display powers that would have been similar to what he used in the
game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Logan, he could
always ask him to program it, so his powers looked different when
performing it in the game. This way, his ability would still be kept
secret from the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Sam didn't want
to tell Nate this; first of all, it was only a theory, and he wasn't
a hundred percent sure this was right. The second thing was, he
wanted to see the joy on Nate's face when he found out the Cursed
Child and Blood evolver were the same person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the martial
arts hall, two people were sitting opposite each other quietly. Quinn
couldn't believe what he had just heard. Of course, people weren't
able to just leave the military freely when they wanted, especially
for a teacher still in the middle of their term. But what Quinn
didn't know was Leo had multiple conditions set when he had agreed to
join, one of them allowing him to leave whenever he wished. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This wasn't normal
for teachers or military to have but it was one of the things that
allowed them to sway him over to thier side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This news had made
Quinn upset. Leo was the first adult who treated him normally even at
a low power level, and even after finding out he was a vampire. There
weren't many people out there like him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can I ask
why?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course,
it's why I wanted to speak to you,&quot; Leo replied. &quot;I started
to realize it after what happened during the event. You know, I know
you, Peter and the Boy Fex were the same types of people. The student
Fex hasn't returned, and we were told he transferred to another base
due to complications, but when trying to find out more about what
happened to him, I couldn't. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not only that
but during the event itself, I met another that was like you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is he talking about
a vampire? The others said someone had come to collect Fex. Is it
possible that it's who he's talking about?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My guess was
that she was there to save Peter, and now that Peter is no longer
here, I believe they succeeded. But during that time, the two of us
fought.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this was
shocking to Quinn. Seeing that Leo was fine, even during the event,
must have meant he could go toe to toe with an adult vampire. Leo was
indeed powerful. At the same time, Quinn wished he was there at the
time to see the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could have learnt
a lot of things watching two skilled participants. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If the two of
us fought at full strength, I honestly don't know which of us would
win. Our confrontation was short, but it was enough for me to realize
that being here has made me a little soft. After the war, I thought
it might have been my time to rest and teach a new generation.
However, I didn't realize how corrupt the current system is. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not only that,
but it's now too risky for me to be here. I don't regret my
involvement in helping you kids. It brings joy to my heart. But if
the military were to find out, I don't know what would happen. There
seem to be greater forces at play here that we can not see. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, let me
tell you. There's a war coming. Whether it will be against each
other, humans against humans, against the Dalki, or an unknown force,
I do not know. But I want to be there to protect my friends and
family when I can. To do that, I need to train once again, and I can
not do that here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The feeling that
Quinn had was the same as Leo. He thought others wouldn't have this
feeling of worry over their shoulder. That the current life they're
living now could be taken away at any second. And the last person he
thought would feel they would need to get stronger was Leo. He was
already plenty strong. Yet, he still felt like the need to get
stronger to protect those around him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you for
telling me. I understand, but why did you feel the need to tell me.
After all, you know I'm different.&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then smiled at
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Because
although we may be different in one way, I feel like we are nearly
precisely the same in another. Both of us want to get strong to
protect those around us. When we first met, I felt it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As a leaving
gift, there are two things I want to give you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then reached
around behind him and pulled out what looked like three beast
crystals. Each one with its outer layer transparent in colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are these
beast crystals?&quot; Quinns said as he looked closely at them. &quot;What
level are they at? They're so clear!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;These crystals
are at the advanced level. They are specially chosen to be used to be
made into a gauntlet type weapon. I wish I could have given you one
of my own weapons, but there is a particular reason why I can't. But
this is the next best thing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo said as he tried
to place the crystals into Quinn's hand, but almost immediately,
Quinn pushed the crystals back towards Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't. I
didn't earn these myself. It doesn't feel right.&quot; Said Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now is not the
time to be so foolish. When you are fighting an enemy, do you think
they care how you got these crystals? When you need to protect those
close to you, does it matter where you got that power from? Or would
you rather see those close to you die because of some silly pride?&quot;
Leo was quite stern and straight when he said this, but he needed to
be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was only 16
years old, but soon, he would turn into an adult and leave, and who
knows when the war would start again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing Leo's
wise words, Quinn took the crystal and placed them in his lap for
now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The second
thing I wanted to give you is not a gift, but something that can only
be taught. First of all, tell me what tier do you think my weapon is
at?&quot; Leo asked as he pulled his sword out and placed it down for
Quinn to look at. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had seen Leo
defeat a Dalki with a single strike, and he knew he was powerful. To
be able to be so strong, it had to be at a great tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it a
legendary tier weapon?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, you
would be more surprised then when I tell you it is only at the King
Tier Level!&quot; Leo replied. &quot;In the past, before beast tier
weapons even existed, there was a small group of people who would be
able to cut giant stones with their swords. Lift buildings ten times
their weight and slow down the ageing process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yet, not a
single one of them had what we know today as abilities, but they
certainly had powers beyond that of a normal human.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, Quinn
thought these humans sounded like Vampires, with the things they
could do, but it was clear Leo wasn't going in that direction. Even
though he knew Quinn was different, not once had he called him a
vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I am a
descendant of these types of people, this isn't an ability, and in
truth, every human out there is capable of achieving such results.
Some even achieve it without realizing it. It's what saved me during
the war. This thing is inside our bodies, and it's known as Qi. I
want to teach you this special technique, and hopefully, you will be
able to use it wisely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But before
even that, I will need to explain to you how I came to learn of it
and how I also became known as the hero, the blind swordsman.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

word was foreign to Quinn. He had never heard of it before or even
heard someone mention it. From the way Leo spoke about it, it sounded
like some mystic energy that perhaps people used to harness a long
time ago. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking back, Quinn
started to remember something Vorden had told him a while ago. At one
point Vorden had managed to copy Leo's powers. When looking at Leo,
he could see the same thing he could, yet Vorden's could feel his own
energy at the time was far weaker then Leo's. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whatever it was,
Quinn wanted to learn about it. He was ready to listen to Leo's
story. For back then during the war, he had been classified as a
hero, and he had even seen the power first hand. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Even before
the introductions of abilities, the world was a cruel place.
Discrimination existed back then just like it does now but in
different forms. As for me, I was abandoned and left outside a temple
by my parents, my only guess is they couldn't deal with the idea of
raising a blind baby. Although to this day I don't really blame them.
</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Form what I
had learned, later on, the country I grew up in was a poor one, and
the place even worse. People had children in hopes that they would be
able to better thier lives in the future. Work on the farm, help put
in the village. But a blind perosn would be disadvantaged when it
came to these things, and I would only be another mouth to feed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;In the end, I
think my parents loved me enough to make sure I arrived at a place
they could trust. Rather than just abandoning me, and for that
reason, I can't say I hate them.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had also heard
some stories of parents who had given up on thier kids, after
learning thier MC cells had a low limit. It seemed rather than
getting better, things had only gotten worst since the past. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Luckily for
me, it wasn't an ordinary temple they had dropped me at. Noticing I
was blind, they knew it would be pointless to bring me to an
orphanage. If people had the choice out of a baby that was perfect or
one that couldn't see it would be a long time until a soul gentle
enough would take me in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;However, he
also felt like he could greatly help me, for he was a master of Qi.
He ran a dojo and taught many students and at first, he decided to
teach me, not because he wanted me to learn how to fight, but he
thought it would greatly help me grow and navigate my way around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You see, Qi
lets you feel the energy of living things around you. In a way, my
Master felt like if he taught me this, he would be giving me a vision
I never had. After years of learning and growing up by my master
side, a strange thing happened. When I mastered how to use Qi, at the
same time, I had unlocked my ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At the time I
didn't know this and abilities weren't widespread and were still kept
secret. When I explained what I could see, My Master told me not to
tell anyone about it, but for the first time, I felt like I could see
and join in with my fellow brothers and sisters with thier training. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My ability
helped me progress faster than those around me, as I was able to see
the flow of energy that my Master would often talk about easier. When
sparing with my fellow brothers, it would give me an advantage. Every
human has Qi, but a lot don't know how to grow or use it properly.
When one would attack, I would see the Qi move before them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fast forward
several years and the war with the Dalki had started. The use of
weapons clearly didn't work, and it looked like the human race would
soon die. I was young and hot-headed back then but continually argued
with my Master, asking why hadn't we gone to join the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We were a
small group of only thirty students, but I knew with our unique
talents we would be able to help some people at least. However, my
Master said our home was here, and it wasn't our place. The temple
oversaw a small town full of life. It was away from the war and all
the fighting. We were up relatively high, and it seemed like nobody
had found us yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But every day
I would watch news of what was going on. That's when people with
abilities started to come forward. They began to turn the tide of the
war. They were hailed as heroes and continued to be cheered and
supported around the whole world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;'That could
have been me' I thought. I was envious, jealous of these ability
users. We could have helped and also been a part of those groups. Yet
even with our power, we did nothing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Later on the
discovery of the portals were made soon after and that led to beast
weapons. The war was still ongoing, and now the world was into heavy
recruitment. People didn't have a choice, if you were old enough, you
were told to fight.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Knowing this
piece of information, I did something I wish I had never done. The
small town on top of the mountain was unregistered with any country.
Nobody knew of our existence. I didn't want to miss out again. What
was the point of having all this power and skill and never being able
to use it? Shouldn't we have used it to help the fight? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;One week, I
went down to the nearest city and reviled that there was a whole town
of people to the World alliance. They immediately sent in thier
soldiers and told everyone to relocate. They moved us all to another
planet. An Orange portal planet at the time. Our job was to defeat
the beasts and obtain the crystals, delivering them to the army. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They had given
us guns that worked against the basic tier beats but after that thier
armour or hide would be too tough. However, they didn't know about
our talents, and even without the weapons, we were able to complete
our tasks better then they had expected. In return, they finally gave
us beast weapons and we even formed a special unit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The planet had
become a peaceful place, and we had managed to make a settlement
similar on the planet, to what we had back on earth. But then, the
Dalki came and attacked. The bulk of us, including my Master and me,
was out on a hunt for beats. When our group returned, the whole
village had already nearly been destroyed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When we
arrived we could see a single Dalki ship, which usuelly contained a
unit of twelve. We fought with them till the bitter end and the only
ones that had survived the fight were my Master and me. All of our
pupils and everyone in the village had died. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It was because
of me the whole town had been relocated to the planet. There was a
good chance we could have continued living peacefully on earth. Not
only that, but me and my Master never spoke again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When telling the
story, Quinn could feel the sadness and guilt in his words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But I don't
think it is your fault,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;There was no
guarantee they would have never found you on that mountain in the
first place, you might have even survived longer moving to the planet
and also if you do have the power, I don't see why it's wrong to try
fight back?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And this is
why I wish to tell you my story, so you don't end up making the same
mistake I did,&quot; Leo replied. &quot;You see now at my age I
realised a few things I could have done differently. Why did I have
to get the whole town involved in my mess, and my fellow brothers? If
I wanted to fight, I could have done it on my own? But no, I was
scared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Worse then
that, they had things to lose, my Master's whole family was in that
village, his wife, his kids and the same for the others. Where I had
nothing, I had no family, no one to worry about and just had my power
and skills. Or that's what I thought. When I lost everything, I
realised I did have a family, but it was a little too late. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;From that
event, my Master and I had gotten quite famous. For it was the first
time a planet or group were able to fend off and kill all the
invading Dalkis. I used this as an opportunity. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;With this huge
burden and regret on my back, I decided to take vengeance against the
Dalki. I showed the military my powers, something my Master told me
to never do and went on the front lines. I fought well and was hailed
a hero, I became one of the heroes I had heard about on TV, but when
I reached that point, I didn't feel any better about myself, and the
praise wasn't as great as I imagined. All I wanted to do was turn
back time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I still don't
understand everything there is to understand about Qi. When the other
students died, it seemed like a part of them was transferred into the
beast equipment they were using at the time or at least thier Qi.
It's stronger than your standard equipment but will only work with
the use of your own Qi. That is why I can not give you any of my own
weapons yet. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second Leo
placed his hand on top of Quinn's head, he started to try and
transfer a part of his own Qi into his body, but unlike how he
thought it would go, it proved to be a bit of struggle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'It feels like
something is trying to block the process; the strange purple energy
is cutting off my own energy.' Leo thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo had never tried
this before, so he was unsure if this was the standard procedure or
was it because Quinn wasn't exactly human. He attempted again, only
this time, being a bit more forceful. Even with humans, some bodies
were more willing to accept outside forces of power than others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the same time,
this was happening. A message had appeared in front of Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System, I need
to ask you, do you think it will be a problem if I accept this Qi?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I honestly
don't know either.&quot; The system replied. &quot;Just like you, I
have never heard of this before. The things that he described humans
being capable of doing, a strong vampire would have been able to do
them anyway. Our bodies would naturally start to get stronger as we
progressed our skills. So we mainly focused on those aspects. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This doesn't
mean we can't learn Qi, but I guess that there was never a need for
it in the first place.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was struggling
with what to do. If he could learn something that even the vampires
didn't know, then wouldn't this allow him to gain a slight edge? At
the same time, the system itself seemed always to want to help him,
unlike the System AI who chose to keep secrets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, judging by
the fact that the system had named &quot;Qi&quot; an unknown
substance, would most likely also mean that whoever created the
system didn't know of Qi either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'So, is the system
just trying to be extra safe?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If it were me,
I would do it.&quot; The system said. &quot;I don't see a huge
downside, and I can't imagine this teacher of yours wanting to hurt
you. Besides, it would be quite an interesting experiment to see,
don't you think? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah with me
as the lab rat who's the one going take the fall for it if anything
went wrong,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After thinking about
it for a while, he eventually decided to take the plunge. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'If Leo can give
this strange power to me, then if anything went wrong he should be
able to take it back as well. If he wanted to hurt me, he would have
done so many times already. And this is his leaving gift. Too many
people have already left, and I have nothing to remember them by.'
Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The energy that Leo
was trying to share suddenly started to go through; there was nothing
different on his end, apart from being more forceful. He didn't quite
understand what was happening but went along with it anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only frame of
reference he had, was what his master had done to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As this energy
passes through I want you to remember this feeling. In a moment my Qi
will join with yours. I have put in a small amount that shouldn't be
able to take or damage yours in any way. I have only done this to
guide it around your body.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his eyes
closed, Quinn started to imagine it. He could feel a glowing feeling
travelling from down his head into his body like a little ball of
bright light. It carried on moving through his body until it
eventually reached his belly. That's when the size of the energy
started to grow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The two
energies appear to have attached.&quot; Said Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good, good
you're a fast learner like I was.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still attached to
Quinn's head, Leo started to move the energy around so Quinn could
get the hang of the feeling. He moved it from his hand to the edge of
his fingertips all the way to his toes and continued to move it
around his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When you learn
to control this feeling yourself, you can start to implement it into
things you touch, including weapons. Not only will you be able to
activate beast gear as others do, but you will be able to do a second
unlocking. Now, this doesn't work on all equipment and usually only
high-level equipment. This second unlocking is basically what we
currently call a weapon skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Have you ever
thought why when forgers create a weapon, even if they both use the
same material, one weapon can have a skill attached to it and one can
not? It's because without realising it, they have learnt how to
harness Qi into their forging techniques to create this second
unlocking.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had been a long
time since the two had been doing this and Quinn hadn't even
realised. He had been so calm and focused on the feeling. It was as
if he had entered a peaceful state. He couldn't tell what was going
on outside and only focused on the energy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay the
session is over, I will now move the energy out of your body. This
can feel a little weird, so bear with me, and you may also feel a
little weak after.&quot; Leo explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The force that was
in his stomach suddenly split from the larger force. It felt as if
someone had reached down into his throat and pulled something from
Quinn's stomach. It surely was an uncomfortable feeling for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The energy travelled
upward and eventually stopped at the top of his head, where Leo's
hand was placed. Once again, Leo could feel his energy stuck there.
The purple aura that surrounds Quinn's body started to gather around
the top half of Quinn's upper body as if it didn't like what Leo was
trying to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The same type of
message had appeared when Leo tried to take out the Qi, but before
Quinn could reply and while he was reading the message. Leo continued
to try to take the energy out from Quinn forcefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Last time, I
struggled a bit as well, maybe I just need to be a little more
forceful? At worst, I will only take some of the boy's energy that he
will reign over time.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, I'm just
going to pull a little harder, it shouldn't hurt but that strange
feeling, you might feel it again,&quot; Leo explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, wait!&quot;
Quinn shouted, but it was too late. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The energy had been
forcefully pulled from Quinn, and the message had disappeared.
Quickly opening his eyes, he could see Leo standing back with his arm
held out as if it was on fire, but Quinn was unable to see what he
could see. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When forcefully
pulling the energy out, he had not only pulled out his and Quinn's Qi
into his body, but the strange purple aura surrounding it. He could
see the force entering his body from his arm, and it was quickly
taking over and spreading. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you okay
?&quot; Quinn asked worriedly. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's not your
fault boy. I was too rash. I should have known you were different, so
your body may have reacted differently. Just don't say another word
while I concentrate.&quot; Leo said as he sat down on the floor and
closed his eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He tried his best to
combat the strange purple energy that was now inside him with his
own. Moving his Qi to combat it, but it was a force he was unfamiliar

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn asked that
question, his dull brown eyes started to light up red, and a
connection was starting to be felt between his energy and the one
flowing through Leo's body as well. </FONT></FONT>

this. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No matter how much

could do was slow it down. Eventually, he realised that the purple
energy would take over his entire body. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot;

Leo. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo opened his eyes,

him when talking to someone. His eyes looked, different to before,
they too had started to glow red. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could hear the
sniffles and sobs coming from Quinn. It gave him an idea of what was
happening to him. For the boy known as Peter once had regular human
energy flowing through him. That one day changed to purple as well. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn
didn't care about that for now. He was far too worried about how Leo
would react, not only had he turned him into a vampire he had also

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I feel great!&quot;
Leo responded in a surprisingly upbeat tone. What he was saying was
the truth, and it wasn't just to make Quinn feel better. He had felt
like he had obtained a whole new body. His hearing was already
sensitive before, but now it was even better, as, for his eyesight,
there was no improvement in that department. He was still unable to
see anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then closed his
eyes and tried to activate his ability, but there was nothing. The
aura he could see before and the wireframe everything he viewed
objects, the walls, they could no longer be seen. Still, he did not
panic, he took a deep breath and thought back to when he was at the
temple. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to focus

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ability was also
compatible with vampires, the only downside was, his MC cells had
been refreshed and had reverted back to when he had first discovered

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well then, I
never thought I would ask you this question as quite honestly, I
didn't think I would get this deeply involved in your troubles, but
it seems like I have done. So what am I, or maybe I should ask, what
are we?&quot; Leo asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was something
Quinn was never prepared for, he had envisioned telling people one
day what he was but not right now. Revelling the truth to his friends
compared to his teacher was a lot harder for some reason. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wasn't ready, but

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a long

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them sat
down once again opposite each other. When looking at Leo, a smile
could still be seen on his face as he was happy with his newfound
body. It made things a little easier for Quinn when speaking. Quinn
started by explaining that he was a vampire, Leo didn't interrupt and
allowed him to thoroughly explain everything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started off
with his own experience, stating how his body was stronger, faster
and his sight was even better than before. All though they quickly
went over the sight part since it had nothing to do with Leo. Then
the hard parts had come, the downsides of being a vampire. Leo would
now be affected by sunlight and suddenly feel weaker during the day,
and he would have to consume blood to fill his hunger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finishing
explaining everything about Vampires, Quinn then also went to explain
about what had happened so far, and Leo was starting to paint a
picture of why people kept turning up and also the relation of Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He felt like this

how the others came after Peter, they could now come after Leo as
well. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After everything was
said and done, Quinn looked downward at the floor waiting for Leo's
response. He couldn't even look at him right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo was busy
thinking, the women he had met at the event who tried stopping him
and the flask filled with blood. Everything was starting to make
sense. And it seemed like even the vampires had thier own set of
rules to follow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You kids have
had a lot on your shoulders this whole time. No wonder you had so
many mistakes and mishaps along the way. This is too much for anyone,
never mind someone your age.&quot; Leo responded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, you're
not mad?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then stood up
from where he was standing, he wished to test out his new body and
skills. Without saying anything, he walked to the centre of the
martial arts hall, and Quinn watched carefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He swung his blade
as fast as he could in all sorts of directions. The speed was amazing
that even Quinn, who had better eyesight than most was struggling to
keep up with it. Not just that, but the sound, he could tell from the
sound alone those strikes would cause serious damage to anyone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While continuously
swinging the blade, Leo could feel something strange. A new energy,
it wasn't like the Qi he typically used, but something was bubbling
and boiling up inside of him. He continued to swing his blade until
eventually, he released this energy out of his sword with a strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the swing of
the sword, shortly after a large line of red aura went out following
it. The attack continued going forward until it had just disappeared
before hitting the wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Blood swipe!&quot;
Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, so I guess
this is a skill from the vampires then. It seems powerful.&quot; Leo
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But this wasn't just
any blood swipe. From looks alone, Quinn could tell it was larger,
faster and more powerful than any blood swipe he had ever produced.
With Leo being plenty strong before and now with his vampire body and
powers on top of it, he truly might have just created a monster. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
going to do now, if you want I can help you. If you need blood, I
have friends that can help and if you have any questions you want to
ask I can help?&quot; Quinn said, still feeling guilty about the
whole thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, I still
haven't changed my decision to leave this place. I think now that
this has happened; it's given me more reason to do so than ever
before. I hope you understand.&quot; Said Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know, if
you wanted to, you could order him to stay.&quot; The system said.
&quot;He would have to comply since he is under you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then before
you go, please take this.&quot; Quinn removed the ring from his
finger and threw it over to where Leo was. For a brief second Quinn
forgot he was blind and was afraid the ring would just hit the floor.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But like a bat,
based on the ting sound he was able to locate where roughly where it
would be, then the short range of his ability would do the rest. He
grabbed it and felt around before realising what it was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm guessing
this isn't a normal ring?&quot; Leo asked as he could see the red
aura surrounding it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That ring will
allow you to walk freely in the daylight. It will make you still feel
human and don't worry, I can make another one. You gave me two gifts
so at least let me give you this.&quot; Quinn said before he could
refuse. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Leo was to be
travelling on his own, unlike Quinn, he didn't have the system to
help him. Any questions he had about the changes that were happening
in his body, he would have to learn how to deal with it on his own.
The ring would help him greatly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn still had
other ways to combat the sun, such as his shadow void and the suit.
He also could always make another ring, but perhaps not one as good
as the one he had obtained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo started to walk
back towards Quinn and stood in front of him. <FONT FACE="Tahoma, serif">���</FONT>Remember

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then got down on

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the way there he
started to notice something different walking through the halls.
Casually, people would look at him, they were still many students
surprised that Quinn was as strong as he was that day, but that
wasn't what felt strange or different. Even as a level one, there
would be those that stared at him, or would treat him as if he was
invisible. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking down at his
watch, he could see the number six on display. What felt different,
was the fact that no students were calling him names, no one
purposely barged into him and no one was trying to start a fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then, as soon as
Quinn turned around the corridor to enter the VR centre, he saw three
boys pinning a student up against the wall. On his wristwatch, was a
level 2 power level. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why didn't you
do what we asked? We told you that we needed that project by
tonight!&quot; The student yelled as he slammed the level 2 student
up against the wall again. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you

recognised who it was. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, you.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just let the

would you?&quot; Said Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shut up, I bet
you think you're hot crap now don't you Quinn!?&quot; Another student
said by his side. &quot;But we ain't weak, and there's three of us. I
bet we could still kick your arse.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, how
about we make it a three on three.&quot; Another student said as they
appeared from behind Quinn. As soon as they saw who this was, the
students immediately stormed off without saying another word. </FONT></FONT>

well, and when Quinn turned around, he could finally see who had come
to his aide. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a student

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At least that

off into the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn disliked the
big four. Even though they wielded so much power, even as students,
they did nothing to change the situation. It was as if they liked the
way things were set up. So he decided to shrug Burg off, and continue
with his business. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Checking his

decided to decline the invite. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, so I
can't find the Cursed Child and now the Blood Evolver won't even

this. That's it I give up, it's time to call it a day and log off.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam suddenly
realised that his guess was spot on, and started to laugh at the fact
that Nate hadn't understood yet. He had decided to invite him, in a
way to reveal who he was to Nate. During the tournament, he said he
promised to fight with him. It was his way of telling him he was the
blood Evolver. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a second Nate
paused, the cogwheels in his brain were starting to spin, the words
spoken sounded familiar, but it was like he had no frame of
reference. It was nearly there, as the pieces began to turn and then
finally, it had clicked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait….wait…no..no.&quot;
Nate said as he pointed his finger at the avatar in front of him,
shaking.&quot;You're saying you're the Cursed Child!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He quickly opened up
his system to confirm that he was indeed in a match with the Blood

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nate, right?&quot;
Quinn said, which was the final nail in the coffin. Only Quinn, the
Cursed Child knew his real name instead of his in-game name. &quot;It's
a little complicated, but as the shadow power isn't a publicly owned
power, I can't use it in the system.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate stood there
still for a while, as he started to process everything. His whole
world had been turned upside down in an instant. Now thinking about
it, the set of moves used in the event, the flash steps, the fancy
kicks. It was something he should have figured out sooner. But the
belief that a perosn could only have one ability was what was
stopping him from believing that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But, he didn't care
about what secrets he had. If he was in the same position, he
probably wouldn't tell anyone what was going on either. He only had
one thing to ask. &quot;Are you able to fight at full strength in the
game?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn shook his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then this is
not our stage to fight. If you can't use your shadow powers here,
then even if I defeat you, it won't feel like a victory. I already
beat you before, but I want to fight the real you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn smiled, as he
expected this, although he was looking forward to a fight, he too
wanted to fight Nate at full strength and while in the game. Even
Nate would be disadvantaged in the game as it wasn't able to emulate
a soul weapon. As well as the fact that Quinn was able to use his
blood attacks freely with no consequences. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wish to
fight you at full strength as well one day,&quot; Quinn replied. The
two had a strange relationship. Even though they wished to fight each
other, it wasn't as enemies, but it was just out of display for pure
skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm in my
second year now, which means I won't be in the military next year.

finished getting rid of every trace of Pure there was in her room.

been thrown out of the Hundred Ranks and banned from coming back to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, that's
fine. I will look after Cia. Can I just ask, have the school tried
contacting her parents about this at all?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, we wanted
to inform them immediately, but with the details that are registered,
we aren't able to get in touch. If we do, I'll let you know straight
away.&quot; Hayley replied and left as soon as she finished since she
had a hectic schedule ahead of her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Entering back in the
room, she could see Cia had opened her wardrobe and was looking at
her clothes and items as if they were all foreign to her. After that,
she pulled out her bag from underneath the bed, and with the things
inside, she picked them up one by one, but still, she could not
remember anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you know
me well?&quot; Cia asked with her voice shaky as if it was about to
crack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla came over and
sat on her own bed, which was not too far from Cia's, while looking
at her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No one at the
school knows each other that well since we all came from different
schools before, but we were roommates since day one, and you and I
used to be on the same team.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Through her words,
she could see that Cia was trying to remember, trying to think back
if there was anything, but there was nothing. After realizing this,
Cia started to break down in tears again. She was crying with her
hands covering her face and sobbing away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla quickly came
over, and out of instinct gave her a big hug to her side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay,
Cia, even if you don't remember everything, it doesn't matter. You
can make new memories, right? Who knows, maybe your life before was a
bad one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Cia continued to
cry; it didn't matter if it was a bad one to her, she just wanted to
remember who her parents were, how she grew up as a kid. She couldn't
even remember the person who was comforting her right now, and it all
was a terrifying thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Will she be like
this forever?' Layla started to think. 'Perhaps removing all her
memories was too cruel in the end; I should ask Quinn tomorrow if
there's anything we can do.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That night, the two
girls decided to sleep in the same bed together. It was the only
thing that made Cia feel safe now, having someone who knew her next
to her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day, when
Layla had woken up, she looked at her wristwatch to notice it
blinking away. Cia's face by her side was a little puffy from all the
crying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She quickly got out
of bed and listened to the message quietly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Layla, if you still
want to do this, let's all meet in the park forest where we trained
with Peter at ten AM; everyone in the group will be there.' The
message had been sent by Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
watch, she realized it was nine AM now, so she quickly got dressed
and did her best to get ready as soon as possible. The sound of
opening and closing of wardrobes had eventually woken Cia up, as she
rubbed her swollen red eyes to see Layla in a rush to go somewhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why are you up
so early?&quot; Cia asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have to go
for my usual morning... er run,&quot; Layla replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can I… Can I
come with you?&quot; Cia asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing these words
caused pain in Layla's heart. She could tell she was afraid to be
left alone still. But she had no choice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You get some
rest, I really need to leave now, but I promise when I'm done and
come back, we can spend all the time you want together.&quot; She
replied as she rushed off and left the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Yesterday. When
returning to his room, Quinn opted to act normal about everything
that had happened so far. He planned to meet everyone the next day
anyway, so it would have been best to explain everything in one go.
So he had yet to tell Vorden about what happened to Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the boys were in
the park woods. They were quite deep in away from the actual park,
and no one would travel in here unless they were up to no good or
just wanted to go for a walk through the woods. Logan had spread out
his little spiders in all directions in a large circular manner; that
way, if someone had decided to come into the woods, they would know. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, anything
interesting happened to you guys yesterday?&quot; Vorden asked,
trying to break the boredom while waiting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He hated to admit
it, but everything had been kind of normal so far, and due to all the
excitement that had happened, things felt boring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The usual.
Just worked on tinkering with my gadgets; I could go into detail of
what I managed to accomplish yesterday if you are really bored.&quot;
Logan replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No thanks,&quot;
Vorden said, knowing he would be bored out of his mind listening to
Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I
certainly have some interesting news for you all, but we will wait
until Layla gets here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of
footsteps and rustling leaves could be heard stomping on the ground.
No one was worried as Logan didn't cause any alarm, and shortly
after, they could see Layla arriving all huffing and panting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry I
woke up a little late,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oof, and on
your big day as well, huh.&quot; Said Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The groups were
standing in a circle in the forest, and Quinn walked into the center
to speak to them all. &quot;First, before we do this, I have
something important to tell you all, it is about Leo…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn proceeded to
tell the others what had happened yesterday. He didn't go into
details about Qi, as it seemed to be something that was meant to be
kept secret and passed down to those they chose. Still, he explained
how Leo had been accidentally turned while trying to help Quin get
stronger, also informing them how he had chosen to leave the school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone was shocked
by this; they couldn't even believe what they had just heard. It was
as if one surprise had come after another as Quinn explained the
details. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, so
you're saying Leo's a vampire now just like you. Then is he okay for
blood? Is everything going to be okay?&quot; Vorden said in a panic;
he clearly seemed to think this was a huge problem, while Quinn
remained calm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think he
will be okay. It seems like he already left yesterday night,&quot;
Quinn said, placing his fist on his chest. The connection between the
two was now gone, meaning he was no longer close by. &quot;I
explained everything to him, and you, Vorden, should know the most
how powerful he is.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden started to
think back about when he had copied Leo's power. Even for him and the
multiple different powers he had wielded before, Leo's was surely
special and different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Since we're
all involved in this, I thought you guys should know. Especially
since right now, we're about to dive in even deeper.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems like
being a human is quickly going out of fashion,&quot; Logan commented;
now, everyone was looking at Logan strangely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Was that supposed
to be a joke?' Layla thought. Right now, they didn't know what was
more shocking, the fact that Leo, their teacher, had turned into a
vampire or that Logan had tried to make a joke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ignoring the small
comments, Quinn wanted to get down to business and turned to look at
Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, we don't
know what's going to happen to you; you could turn into a ghoul, like
Peter, but this time we have Logan helping us so we shouldn't have
the same complications as before, or you could turn into a vampire,
like Leo. We have Vorden's blood for that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah, jeez, now
I'm going to be your little snack bar for you two,&quot; Vorden
commented. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Or, you could
become something that we haven't seen before. Are you sure you want
to go through with this because there's no turning back?&quot; Quinn
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As long as it
will make me stronger, then yes. I'm sick and tired of being useless
to you guys, and before you say I'm not. You need to start to look at
the people who are coming after us. As we make more enemies and go
higher up, they keep getting stronger and stronger, and I want to
rescue Erin from Pure. At the time, I did what I thought was right to
save her, and I know she will be safe, but the longer she stays
there…&quot; Layla didn't finish her last sentence. But after
learning of their strange tactics, and the death pill that Cia had,
Quinn knew the place wasn't the best. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like before,
when performing the Blood Ritual on Peter, they decided to lay Layla
down on a pile of leaves. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>''This should make

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan stood on one
side while Vorden stood on the other. After helping Quinn prepare
everything, both of them took a step back away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, you don't

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know…
it's just to be safe. We don't want a chunk of our arms or legs to go

through last time. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan nodded while
taking another step even further back. &quot;It's always best to be
careful. Especially when we don't know the probabilities, I'm sure
you understand.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The boys were just
making Layla feel even worse. It seemed unlikely that she would be
turned into something that the others should be truly scared of, but
the words of the others had gotten to her. When Quinn was about to
begin the next steps, she grabbed him by the wrist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not that I'm
having second thoughts or anything, but do you know what I could
possibly turn into?&quot; She asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn himself didn't
really know the answer to this, so instead, he reverted the question
to his system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hmm, that is
quite a hard question to answer.&quot; The system said. &quot;You
see, I'm not sure even now, as back then, you must have heard many
tales about creatures or demons. They were around during my time, so
I would assume they are still spread today as folklore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The truth is
all those tales had definitely originated from somewhere and had some
type of truth to them. Most of them being subclasses of vampires. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You have the
classes that are closely related to the vampires, with these types, I
would place them in something called category A. They are similar to
your standard vampire but perhaps a little unique when comparing them
with slight differences. Some of these can evolve into vampires,
later on, some branch of slightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A few examples
include a halfling, you should know this one quite well, a
fledgeling, thrall, and dhampir. These classes tend to be well
balanced in terms of skill; they have good magic and melee abilities.
With each one having thier own specialities when they later evolve.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The next
category is category B; I call this one the Undead category. This is
where Peter (the ghoul), Wight, Wendigo, and a few others fit into.
These have next to no magical power. But most of them make up for it
with their Melee attack strength.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And finally
you have Category C, I call these the others. I know it's lame, but
truthfully it's because they don't really have much in common with
each other, or at least, not as much as the others. They usually tend
to be strong in magical power while weak in the speed and strength
department many vampires are known for. Examples are Succubus, Blood
fairy, and the Banshee. The upside about this category is they
usually don't have a huge negative to them like the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Category A,
all need some form of blood, Category B need flesh, whereas C,
although different, depending on what they turn into, don't need
something as difficult as the first two. Of course, there are more
than the examples I have given you, but if you wanted me to list them
all, we would be here all day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Back in the
day, I did quite a bit of research on this, so you have come to ask
the right person. But even as great as I am with my vast amount of
knowledge can not pinpoint the exact reason or thing that will
determine what one will change into. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Emotional?
Me?&quot; Layla said suddenly, but she realized that she was just
letting what the screen said now prove her wrong. So correcting
herself, she tried her best to hold everything in. She cleared her
throat and started again. &quot;Okay, say I am this Hannya demon
thing; the only thing I don't really understand is the feeding off
negative emotions part.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I was to
take a guess,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;I would say it's one of two
things. Just as Quinn gets pleasure from blood, you might be able to
feed off the aura of negative or sad people. Or there is the second
option, you feed by making people negative.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others didn't
say anything, but they felt like Vorden was spot on with his
deduction. That line could only be interpreted like that, and they
just hoped it wasn't the second one. However, the first part might
prove difficult as well. Where were they meant to find negative
people? Would they have to go around the school looking for someone
who had just broken up? Or perhaps start calling people names. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
too much about this.&quot; The System said to Quinn, seeing his
concern. &quot;Remember what I said about category C? Unlike ghouls
or vampires who need blood or flesh to survive, the Hannya don't need
negative emotions to live; this is just what powers them and allows
them to evolve eventually.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was another
thing that Quinn worried about, evolving. He remembered that there
was also a chance that Peter could have evolved into the Wendigo.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So do you know

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ha, ha, this

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So based on
the information, unlike Quinn and Peter, you won't have abnormal
strength or speed,&quot; Logan explained. &quot;But instead magical
abilities, perhaps in a way similar to Quinn's blood abilities. What
about your ability from before? Can you still use that?&quot; Logan
asked. </FONT></FONT>

compatible with vampires or not, but even so, if you really want to,
you could choose a completely new ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla continued to

thought about it. If she moved her hair to the side of her face, it

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think it
would be best to still have an ability that compliments my bow.&quot;
Said Layla. &quot;We don't really know how this magic works, but if
it's like Quinn's blood abilities, it will have a limit before they
can be used again. So it's best to have a backup to use in any case
scenario. And a melee weapon doesn't really suit me since I didn't
get any stronger in the other departments. But I'm not sure if I want
to stick to telekinesis or not. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan's room was
pretty big due to it being one of the VIP rooms. It was even bigger
than Vorden and Quinn's room that was meant to house three people
inside. So there was plenty of floor space. Still, things were lying
all over the floor, and Logan quickly allowed his spiders to get to
work clearing everything and putting it to the side. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a few moments,
the floor looked almost brand new. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They weren't going
to fight so the space was enough. They just needed her to use her
skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla stood in the
middle of the room, and the target of choice for her abilities would
be Quinn. This was because he had a healing factor that they could
rely on, and technically had the strongest body there. He also felt
like it was only right to volunteer himself for something like this.
Being the person who changed her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what do I
do?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess I can
explain what I do when I use my blood abilities,&quot; Quinn
suggested. &quot;You should feel this strange energy in your body
swirling around. Try grabbing onto it, then when you release that
energy, you have a clear image inside your head of what you think the
skill will look like. It's quite similar to how we learn our usual
skills from skill books, only you don't have any reference to go on.
This kind of just works for me.&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan, back on his
computer, pretended to have taken and found more information about
Hannya, when in reality, it was just what Quinn had already told him.
He described the characteristics of the power they used and what the
two skills might look like. Giving out every bit of detail apart from
what the ability did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That thing is

you sure that vampires didn't write that article?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, we won't
know till we try, will we? I don't think it's accurate, but it allows
us to start somewhere.&quot; Logan replied. &quot;Unless you have any
better ideas?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla closed her
eyes, and nearly instantly, she could feel the strange energy that
Quinn was talking about. Maybe it was because she no longer had her
ability, and there weren't many other changes to her body apart from
this one, but she was able to pick it out straight away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as she
thought and grabbed on to this energy more, memories started to
appear in her head, memories of her mother. Memories of her time at
Pure, and memories of her dear friend Erin. Without realizing it, her
face looked sad on the outside, and tears were flowing down them
dropping onto the floor. She tried her best to ignore them and
started to picture one of the skills—spiritual chain. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others could see

themselves to the floor. Everything happened in almost an instant as

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On a particular
planet, when one would look up at the sky, they would discover the
fact that they were three moons, two of the moons shined brightly
allowing a light glow on the surface. While one of the moons had an
important role. It created a permanent eclipse blocking out the sun. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the other two

and shift with the planet's slow rotation to make it so it would
always remain in the dark but still would provide enough heat for
survival. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the planet
that the vampires had chosen to call home. It wasn't a very large
planet, and most of the place was unpopulated, but in one section
there were signs of civilization as life could be seen. Buildings
created from a black hard substance crafted in a jagged style, but
signs of modern technology could also be seen in use. As lights lit
up the streets with a lukewarm glow, not too bright. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The city was
surrounded by what looked like a forest that went all around the
outside of the buildings, and towards the back of it, a single large
mountain. In front of the mountain was a castle that was a quarter of
the size of the mountain itself, it was grand in size and had a sleek
design. Unlike the other buildings, this one was also made of the
black materiel but had been carefully carved out. Creating a perfect
castle. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Going around the
large central castle, either side were fourteen smaller castles. They
equally looked impressive each bearing their own crest on a giant
cloth at the front. However, two of these castles looked a little run
down compared to the rest and displayed no such crest. There was also
no lights or fires lit. Showing no sign of inhabitants in the
buildings. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One of the castle's
family crests displayed a ring with six strings attached to it,
pulling it from above. This was the Sanguinis families castle. Inside
on the bottom floor in their private training hall, a portal had
suddenly appeared floating in the centre of the room. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Two guards dressed

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First to go arrive
through the portal was Peter, although he didn't look like his usual
self as he was disguised as Quinn. Both of his hands remained tied
behind his back, but he was compliant. The one who followed after him
was Fex and eventually Silver. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To remind everyone
that Fex was indeed a criminal, she used her own red string, mixed
with her blood abilities and wrapped up Fex's arms behind him as
well. </FONT></FONT>

rushing off again. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Gosh do they

said in an upbeat tone. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shut it you.&quot;
Silver replied. &quot;Do you know how much trouble you could have
been in? The other families and king are unaware of this situation.
We managed to keep it under wraps.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I knew you
would!&quot; Fex interrupted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver immediately
glared at him back and decided to use even more string wrapping it
around his mouth, so he could no longer interrupt her. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Much better.&quot;
She said. &quot;Because of this, the punishment you will receive will
be dealt with within the family. There is no need for the council to
make a decision. Furthermore, we can use this illegal creator to pin
the blame on one of the other families. Your father will be pleased
and will lighten your punishment.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex noticed that,
Silver had made the extra effort to call him your father. She never
did call him farther herself and always referred to him as the leader
or lord. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm glad you
bought me the right person.&quot; She continued. &quot;The truth was
I had already found out who had created the illegal later on. If you
were to bring me someone else I wouldn't know what to do.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was glad he knew
his sister well, he knew she wouldn't have just stopped to look for
the creator after finding out there was an illegal. This was why part
of his plan was to make Peter look like Quinn, just in case, and it
seems like he was right. However, she was too trusting at times, as
well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her checks would
only go so far, and she wouldn't dream to think Fex would break the
rules and lie to her. She had this naive thought that others upheld
the rules as much as she did. Bringing in someone who was able to
transform, never crossed her mind. In most cases, he would never have
gone this far for someone, but he had made a promise. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A short while later,
the three of them were now in the main room. They all knelt down on
the red rug that led up to a small staircase where a grand chair was
centred, in the chair, the family leader, or Vampire lord of the
Sanguinis, Lee sat. By his side, a middle-aged man with a small
little goatee beard and pointy black hair, his second Vampire knight
that held the same position as Silver. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver had stood up
to give a full report, explaining why the process had taken longer
than she had thought and explained the details clearly. Although she
altered some trying to show her brother in the best light possible.
Saying how he had planned to come back sooner until discovering the
so-called illegal. She went even further stating he had killed the
illegal and brought back the vampire, the route cause of the problem
all on his own. Noting she had next to near no involvement in the
matter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing all of this,
Just made Fex feel bad. His dear sister was doing this all for him,
so he could take all the glory while it was her hard work all along,
and even worse, he had lied about it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is
excellent!&quot; Lee said with a smile. &quot;I can't believe one of
the other families managed to screw up. Creating an illegal in a time
like this. This will greatly cause disfavour to one of the families.
Sin, Call the council to have a meeting immediately, we need to find
out who this scum belongs to, don't tell them why but just say it's
an important matter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes my lord,&quot;

of smoke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My son, you
have always been a trouble maker, and I have hated you for it,
sometimes I even thought you might not be right for this seat after
my time, but you have made this family proud. Fex, I want you to come
to the council meeting with me, I shall inform everyone of your great
feat.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although his father
sounded joyful and happy for this matter, this was making Fex
extremely anxious. When returning, he had expected punishment,
perhaps for Peter to be dealt with before going to the council. Of
course, there was always the chance it would still go to the council,
but now his father wanted to praise his actions in front of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once they found out
the truth, how the vampire that broke the laws is still out there,
and Fex had returned with the actual illegal, the whole family would
be embarrassed and ashamed. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Should I just tell
the truth now?' Fex thought that way, it would save his family from
being embarrassed, but he couldn't. If he was to reveal the
information now, there was a chance that only his family would
continue to keep this under wraps and send out vampires immediately. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the whole council

council meeting</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When a meeting
between the vampire council members would be called, all of the
thirteen leaders from thier castles would have to go and travel to
the main castle. The main castle was where the current vampire king
or queen resided. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside, near the top
floor, but not quite at the very top was the meeting room. Once a
month, the leaders would meet up to discuss current matters or
affairs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Outside of the
regular meetings, an emergency meeting could be called as well. Only
if there was something that needed to be reported to everyone would
they meet up. On this very day, a meeting had been called. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the second
emergency meeting that had been called within such a short time
frame, and the tensions were high. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the room,
there were thirteen chairs equal in size spread across the table.
Behind each seat a flame which burnt bright and strong. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently, all if
the chairs were filled with thier leaders and one of their vampire
knights by thier side. All of them apart from one. The tenth seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most of the room was
dominated by men most looked old while a couple looked young, but it
was impossible to tell the real age of any. Two of the seats were
filled with female leaders as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Besides these
thirteen chairs at either end of the table, thier were two larger
chairs. One Chair slightly bigger than the other, at this moment both
of these chairs were empty as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sitting at the first
Chair near the top of the table was the first leader, an older
gentlemen than the rest. Vampires at the Lord level often had great
control over thier bodies. They could choose when to slow down thier
ageing process. Most at the table had chosen to keep thier appearance
of that of slightly older middle-aged men. Yet for some reason, the
first leader preferred an aged look. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was bald up top,
but his facial hair was heavy around his face going down to his
collar bone, all white in colour. Other than these, the forehead that
seemed to always be in a prominent V shape were his most distinctive
features. On top of this, the old man would never seem to leave
without his trendy black slim walking stick by his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, he never
used the walking stick to walk, but kept it by his side as if his
life depended on it. When the king wasn't present, it was his duty to
be in charge. He still only had equal power as the rest of the
thirteen, but in order for things to proceed more smoothly, the first
leader was placed with this position. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others didn't
mind this, as the first leader was the oldest and seemed to be the
most knowledgeable out of the rest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once everyone was
seated, he banged his walking stick three times across the floor to
signal the meeting would begin, and the room fell silent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I Bryce Cain,
leader of the first seat, will now begin this meeting. This meeting
has been called by the 13th seat leader of the Sanguinis family,
Lee.&quot; The old man said. &quot;I hope you all know that the king
is still resting and will not be attending this meeting. Unless a
matter can not be agreed upon, there will be no need to call him. Now
please, Lee, explain to us why this meeting was called?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Rather than
explain this matter, I would like to bring them In, If I may,&quot;
Lee asked, to which Bryce responded with a nod. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The doors to the
room opened, and in came, Silver, Fex and Peter who was now
officially in a black set of handcuffs. They seemed to be made form
the same material as the buildings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While they walked
into the room, Lee tried to look at the other leaders to see if there
was a reaction from one of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Hm, they all have
pretty good poker faces, maybe they don't know what he has
committed.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no reaction,
Lee had no choice but to continue. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Recently I was
tipped off from our agents that there was something strange going on
at earth. As you all know, my son Fex is young and was soon to have
his ceremony to turn into a vampire noble. I thought this would be a
good opportunity to send him out on the field. In case there were any
mistakes, Silver was sent out after him as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When they
arrived at thier location, Fex my son seemed to have discovered a
Wight. You should all know where this is going. Other than vampires
part of the part A category, all subclasses are to remain here. Which
means, an illegal was created. My son has successfully captured the
illegal.&quot; Lee said, pointing at Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others looked at
Peter carefully, it was clear he was a vampire and a young one at
that. Youngsters, when being turned, would rarely ever turn straight
into vampires for they didn't have the power. So he must have
belonged to one of the twelve there they thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when Bryce
looked at him closer, he felt strange. Even though this was a serious
matter, it was clear that the vampire boy was unafraid. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You all know
why this is a serious matter, first off it wasn't reported. Even if a
leader created a vampire in our current situation, they should report
it immediately. Every family is allowed a maximum of fifteen hundred
members, and last time I checked, every family is at its maximum
amount. If this vampire was creating illegals, who knows they could
even be creating more and perhaps planning another uprising.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Lee had said
this, the twelve leaders started to mumble amongst themselves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;An uprising,
again. This would be a serious matter, indeed.&quot; One leader said.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The family who
has allowed this vampire to be unruly must be punished.&quot; Another
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, Bryce
banged his walking stick on the ground three times, bringing order to
the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wheather or
not it's a serious matter is undecided. Do not speak so freely about
an uprising. An investigation shall be made into the family that this
vampire belongs to. It might just be a stray that has done its own
thing, but just to be sure we shall check thoroughly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now to save us
all time, does anyone care to admit who this vampire in the room
belongs to. If you have nothing to hide, then only the vampire shall
be punished.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The leaders started
to look up and down the table, waiting for one person to be called
out. The leaders didn't remember every vampire member in thier family
and they didn't have a connection with all of them. In the families,
about fifty of them would be connected to the actual leader in some
way, and learn the families unique ability. While the rest of the
vampires would simply work for the families. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason why Bryce
had made the suggestion was from the feeling he was getting, he could
tell that the vampire was quite a strong one for being so young. It
made him believe that the vampire had to be close to the leaders, and
if so, even if they didn't know what he looked like, they would have
felt a connection being this close to him right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it, you
fools!&quot; Lee said in anger. &quot;This is a serious matter, and
you are only wasting our time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It is as lee
said. Very well, there is one way to find out, bring the boy to me.&quot;
Bryce said, and Silver brought Peter along with her, directly to the
first seat, allowing Peter to stand opposite the old man. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex watching this
new precisely what the old man planned to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'It won't work.' Fex
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The old man looked
into Peter's eyes, and his started to glow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Tell us, which
family do you belong to?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone in the room
was sat at the edge of thier seats waiting for an answer but after a
few moments. There was nothing, Peter didn't reply and remained
silent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bryce tried again in
case something was wrong, he looked into his eyes and said the same
words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Tell us, it's
an order of the council. Which family do you belong to!&quot; He
shouted, getting frustrated, but Peter didn't flinch nor did he
reply. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But how is
this possible?&quot; One of the leaders said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Mumbling between
them all began and started again, and the only one in the room who
knew the answer was Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What the first
leader attempted to do, was use his Charm skills to force the
information out of him. One's power would have to be far greater for
this to work, and usually, it would work against a vampire that
hadn't even reached the noble level. Which was why everyone was so
shocked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Peter wasn't a
vampire, he was a Wight an undead. Mind control, sleeping, paralysis
all these things didn't work on an undead. The only one that would be
able to force information out of him, was his creator. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, to Bryce
this only angered him further. There were a few methods to block this
mind control from working, and only another leader would know such a
method. In his mind, it was clear that someone was trying to hide
this information and to do this and go this far, they would have had
a direct connection with the family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine.&quot;
Everyone, we shall gather downstairs in one of the training halls.
&quot;If I can't force the information out of you, then we shall beat
it out of you. I'm warning you now, when I find out who this vampire
belongs to they shall be in serious trouble.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

had done as the first Leader asked. They had moved from the meeting
room, down to one of the training rooms below. When they had entered,

Phil, the teacher said. &quot;It's an honour to even be in your

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Peter entered
the room with Fex and Silver, he was surprised to see how similar it
seemed to the Military Academy. The only difference was it appeared
like they had more respect for the Leaders, and everything was a lot
more organised. Rather than them being compliant and obedient through
fear, Peter could tell even just by looking at the vampires, that
they were obedient through respect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All students were
now sitting on one side of the room. Their teacher was in the front
row, while the Leaders where all lined up at the other side. The
students were nervous just by looking at the Leaders. Some were
already part of a family, due to their close connections. While
others, although they might be under the same banner, wanted to prove
their worth, in order to get a higher position in the family. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The vampires who
weren't directly linked to a family were referred to as the Pool.
Once a year, vampires would be able to move between families that
they were currently registered in, and the students would be able to
select which families they wanted to join. Similar to how seasons
worked in sports. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, spaces
were limited to each family, as there were only a total of 1,500
spaces per family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On a year-to-year
basis, this number would increase, based on a few factors, such as
whether or not the city could handle an increase of vampires that
year. If so, then the allocation number would increase. But that time
had already passed, and all the current vampires had been registered,
setting the number at 1,500 per family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of this number,
fifty of those in the family would have a direct connection with the
Leader in some way. An additional hundred of those would know the
families' ability, while the rest would just be simple soldiers in
the Pool. For those that knew or were to learn the families' ability,
they would bear the families' crest on their uniform. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of this meant
there weren't many students who attended school in the first place,
but the vampires always focused on quality rather than quantity. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bryce stood in the

still chained up by his side. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is your

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Xander immediately
stood up. Most of the vampires there were handsome or beautiful, but
even he seemed like a pretty boy compared to the rest, his brown hair
curled on both sides and having a body frame of a top athlete. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come here,
boy,&quot; Bryce said, noticing that he too had the same crest as
his. Seeing the crest, meant he was one of the hundred selected to be
in the family and thought there must have been a reason for him to be
selected. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Xander had reached

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're going
to make me fight with these,&quot; Peter said as he lifted his hands,
but suddenly, a loud thud was heard. When looking at what had caused
the sound, the black cuffs that were on him had already hit the
floor. In the center of them, it looked like they had been cut. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I didn't even see

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bryce was telling
the truth when he said he wanted to see the students' current
fighting level. There had been reports that they were the worst and
weakest generation the vampires had so far, but that wasn't his main
reason. His idea was allowing Peter to fight there. There were two
chances he could find out which family he belonged to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When people were
desperate and felt like their life was in danger, even vampires
fought with everything they had, and in doing so, he was hoping the
captive would reveal their ability. The second reason was if his life
was in danger, the connection between the Leader and the vampire
would be felt. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bryce went back to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Begin!&quot;
Phil shouted, and Xander immediately charged forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From the get-go,
they could see him spring to action. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No wonder he's
the top student,&quot; One of the Leaders said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah, my Fex is
still faster than him.&quot; Lee started to brag, but of course, that
would be the case. Fex had acquired special training, due to him
being a son of the Leader. He didn't exactly attend normal classes.
Even when he did, he never felt like he fitted in anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, seeing this,
stood still. The others thought Xander was simply moving too fast for
him to react, but that wasn't the case at all. As Xander approached
him, using all of his strength, he threw his fist right into Peter's
face. The blow was hard and blood splattered from his mouth across
the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, his body
hadn't moved a single step from the powerful blow. As Peter turned
his head back to look at Xander, he started to place his hand on his
jaw that seemed to be shattered but was already healing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, that
hurt a bit,&quot; Peter said. This was an unusual feeling for him,
but this was because he still had the blood of Quinn running through
his body, powering him, causing him to feel alive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Xander was slightly
stunned. A blow like that would have knocked most people out, or at
least sent them back a few feet. Still, he regained his composure and
started to punch away at Peter's stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The speed was
amazing, and punch after punch was being delivered. The power was so
strong that Peter had been lifted off his feet, but the punches
continued, not allowing him to fall to the floor. They carried on
moving him slightly back towards the edge of the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought you
said we were meant to watch a show of skill, not a beating!&quot; One
Leader shouted out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought the

another replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh no, the
blood!&quot; Fex panicked. The more Peter was getting hit, the more
of Quinn's blood was being spilt. The aura and smell surrounding
Peter would soon weaken to the point where they would find out who he
really was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Fex wasn't the
only one who could tell what was happening, Peter too. The blood
flowing through him was not only being spilt, but was also being used
to heal his wounds. He felt the power draining from his body fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another punch was
delivered to his body, and his back was now up against the wall. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're done!&quot;
Xander said, throwing out both of his fists at the same time with
more power than before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bryce carefully
looked around to try to look and see if any of the Leaders had any
type of reaction, but there was none. When he turned his head back
around again, he was surprised to see the fight wasn't over. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using all of his

boot to his face. A few seconds later, Xander fell to the floor. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Xander's
body had hit the floor, Phil, the teacher stood up from the floor and
placed both of his hands over his head. The two kids looked around
the same age, and Phil was overly confident that his students would
succeed. Yet, somehow, this unknown kid had the strength to overpower
his best student with just two moves. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, a fight
between any student vampires would be close, even with a skill gap.
But this fight was different. It was as if they were watching
completely different classes of vampires going against each other.
Only a vampire Nobel would be able to do such a thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, maybe

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, a few
moments later, Xander had stood up from the floor and took another
fighting stance. His face was covered in blood that had been gushing
from his nose and was now all over his school uniform. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, Xander,
stop messing around and kick him, bite him, do whatever you can!&quot;
Phil screamed as he was starting to get overly excited. If his top
student lost here, perhaps his family position as a teacher would be
jeopardized. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, on the other
hand, had found a new will to fight. The more blood he would lose,
the quicker he would be discovered. As he got injured too much as
well, it was harder for him to control his MC cells, which would
eventually lead to his transformation giving in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He would do anything
to last a second longer. After seeing how strong just one of the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Xander, this time
moved in again, not as fast as before due to him being cautious now.
Rather than throwing out his punches in rapid succession, he was
carefully placed each one directly, but Peter, for the first time in

each one of the strikes. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, Peter's

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're right,&quot;
Bryce replied. &quot;The other person can't even touch him, but
there's no doubt about it; he's a vampire though and not a noble one.
If one is this strong, he has to be deeply connected to a family. We
need someone to push him, someone to push him to the end.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, hit
me!&quot; Xander shouted, getting frustrated that none of his attacks
seemed to be working. He now went into desperation mode and started
to use some of his blood skills. He performed blood swipes, but if
one couldn't hit someone with their fist, it would equally be useless
to try to use the blood abilities unless they had a skill that slowed
Peter down; other than that, there seemed to be no way for Xander to
win this fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, however, had
decided that he would not strike back, his reason. Delaying the
fight. After a while, the others noticed this too and eventually… </FONT></FONT>

now, your body is shaking.&quot; Bryce said, using his cane to point

Now it makes sense why my skills didn't work earlier. You tricked us.
The blood that resides in his body is no longer strong. Now, unlike
the others, I don't believe that Lee would have called a meeting if
he indeed was in charge of this vampire, and Silver, and Fex, just
now would have been unable to hit him. This means the vampire belongs
to another family, but the question is, Did Fex really betray us or
not? Luckily, there's an easy way to find out.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

my son, he would never betray the family. Although he is a
