<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With morning lessons
over and done with, it was time for Combat lessons to start. Layla
had come over with Erin by her side to Quinn. They weren't exactly
friends now as the two didn't really talk much. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In fact, Erin didn't
really say much at all to anyone. However, over the last few days
after searching for Peter together, they started to hang around each
other more often. They had also practised as a team together
beforehand, and for the first time, Erin had actually called Layla by
her name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These were all huge
steps forward in Layla's eyes, and before they knew it, the two of
them would naturally just be around each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
headed off to the beast weapons class while Vorden had already left
for the elemental class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now sitting in the
room all alone was Peter just blankly staring at the wall Infront of
him. Even his fake friends were no longer talking to him at the
canteen. Earl and his gang had been avoiding him ever since Erin had
threatened them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had also
already gotten their use out of him and no longer needed him anymore.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter continued to
sit there and think back at all the stupid things he had done. If
only he had done this differently, why did he decide not to ask for
help, why did he agree to help them at the time? It had hurt back
then and felt like he was going through hell, but right now, he
couldn't even remember what the pain felt like. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As all these
thoughts ran through his head, and he started clenching his hair in
his hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every time a stupid
memory came up, he would pull his hair, trying to forget it as if he
was pulling the memories out of his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why!&quot;
Peter shouted as he pulled out a clump of hair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why!&quot; He
said again pulling out another. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His hands were now
filled with parts of his hair. He could feel something running down
from the top of his head. He had pulled so hard and so much hair that
blood was starting to drip from his scalp. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn was just
about to leave the second-year building to head to the beast weapons
hall, he paused for a second right by the exit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This whole time he
had been back, not once had he set foot outside in the sun and for
the first time, he would be doing so now. He had asked the AI system
repeatedly what the effects were, but he would never tell him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Calm down Quinn,
you already know you won't die so what's the worst that could
happen?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Quinn is
everything okay?&quot; Layla asked, noticing he had stopped just by
the exit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I'm
fine,&quot; Quinn said as he took a step forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instantly the effect
of the sun had hit him. The ray's affected him more than ever, and a
pounding feeling was heard in his head. He stumbled a little but soon
caught himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It took him a few
moments, but he finally adjusted to the sudden feeling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'70, are you
freaking kidding me!' Quinn shouted in his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, now calm
down.&quot; The System replied. &quot;I thought you would act like
this, so I didn't want to say anything.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At least I had
a chance of fighting in the sun before, I thought if I increased my
stats to at least twenty, suck a few people here and there, I would
be like a normal person in the sun. What am I meant to do now?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well honestly,
I never really had this problem before, back at the kingdom we had
plenty of items that stopped the sun form affecting us. Just take a
look at your inventory. That ring you were looking at is given to the
weakest of our men.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The System was
suddenly revealing a lot more information due to the outburst.
Whenever Quinn would ask the System who he was or if there were other
vampires out there, he would ignore him and pretend he never heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn
needed to deal with one problem at a time and right now, and the sun
was an urgent one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, I can
see you're depressed.&quot; The System said. &quot;How about this.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then opened up
Quinn's menu and went to show him the shadow skills tab. Out of the
ten skills, 3 had been unlocked, but seven were still greyed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You just want
to be able to fight in the sun, right? You see the skill named Shadow
void, it cost a total of twenty skill points. I would recommend you
unlock that next. The skill allows you to create your own space of
shadows. Blocking it from not only the sun but outside viewers as
well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although it wasn't a
permanent solution to Quinn's problem, it was a solution. While Quinn
struggled to walk Layla quickly came over and pulled out an umbrella
over his head. She had kept it on her at all times for situations
like these. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Heh, heh, Vorden,
looks like I'm needed more than you after all.' Layla thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Quinn
started to feel a lot better. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[The sunlight is
being blocked, all stats will return to normal] </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you guys
have to be lovey-dovey in front of me?&quot; Erin said as she saw the
two walking under the umbrella. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We're not a

easily.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What a wimp,&quot;
Erin said as she walked off ahead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't know
why, but Erin's words always seemed to sting a bit more compared to
when others said it to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
had finally arrived at the Martial hall and no longer needed the
umbrella. Once again as he entered, he started to feel his heart
beating faster than ever. He was nervous; the reason was simple. It
was because of Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some reason Leo
had asked that the next time the two of them met, to speak to him.
Although Leo did say that he wouldn't hurt him, those words didn't
exactly reassure him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The classes had
begun as normal with Leo asking the students to warm up by sparing
with each other, but once again Leo had asked Layla to step away as
Leo wanted to be his opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then took Quinn
to the corner of the room away from the others, making sure they
couldn't hear their conversation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you for
saving me in the portal world,&quot; Quinn said first, hoping to get
on his good side by sucking up to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I was just
doing my job, what happened to your gauntlets, there's no energy

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo raised his hand,
telling Quinn to stop speaking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Boy there is
no need, those weren't expensive in the first place, but for
something to break some beast gear, you must have fought against some
beasts then.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
laugh nervously, he wasn't prepared for this and didn't really know
how to answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh no, one of
those Rat beasts jumped at me, and all I did was lift my hand trying
to protect myself. The beast wouldn't let go, so I had no choice but
to take them off and run.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see,&quot;
Leo said as he stood there silent for a moment. &quot;Quinn, do you
know they say when someone goes blind their sense of hearing
improves. Now let me be the first to tell you that is all a myth.
However, my ability does improve my senses, and I can hear your heart
beating ever so loudly.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
think about the question Leo had given him. It was clear that he knew
something about him through his ability, and it was why he had asked
the question in the first place. But rather than out him to his
higher-ups, or try to deal with him himself. He was asking a simple
question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'If I answer this
wrong, will he attack me? Or maybe even turn me in?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But judging by what
he had said earlier. If Quinn was to lie, he would be able to tell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything about the
current human society made Quinn feel sick to his very core. It
wasn't just the government or the military but the originals as well.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When his parents
were fighting in the war, why did they choose to reveal themselves
towards the end and only then share their powers then? Why did the
military design this caste system that put everyone into categories?
In a way, he wanted to see the current society fail. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But did he want
everyone to die? No. Did he want the Dalki to win the war, no, he
didn't want that either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that he thought
about it more, he was in an interesting position. He couldn't exactly
call himself human anymore. If they found out what he was, would they
accept him over to their side? Probably not, humans were scared of
the unknown. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But two people
already had done. Layla and Vorden did know what he was, and didn't
stop speaking to him or treated him any differently. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn knew whats his
answer was. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm on my own

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a second Leo
just stood there silently. He continually looked at the purple flame
burning around Quinn, and then he turned around and walked off
without saying a word. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I guess my answer
was okay then.' Quinn said as he let out a huge puff of air. He felt
like any second now he was about to have a nervous breakdown. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Get yourself a
new weapon kid!&quot; Leo shouted, &quot;You're going to need it for
the portal expedition, and my offer still stands. Feel free to have a
duel with me whenever you wish.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The combat classes
had ended, and Quinn didn't end up doing much in today's session.
With no equipment of his own, he had to pick something else from the
wall. But when he tried using a sword, he realised how much practise
you needed before he could even become half-decent at the thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using his fist just
felt natural to him, especially since nearly all of his skills
required him to use his hands. This meant more than anything that he
needed a new set of Gauntlets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving the
martial hall, he asked to borrow the umbrella Layla had and decided
to head to the library for the rest of the afternoon. There he would
be able to use the public computers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the way there he
opened up his system to check on a few things. Firstly, it was his
crystal inventory. Right now, he had 16 basic tier crystals, 1
intermediate tier crystal, and 1 advanced tier crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system shop had
a set of Intermediate gauntlets for him, and all he needed for them
was three intermediate crystals. There was no requirement of what
type. Then there was the advanced tier crystal that could only be
used as a ring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He finally sat down
on the computer and went on to the market place. He started his
search to see what was the standard price for selling crystals. Right
now, the basic tier crystals were useless to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before logging in to
access the weapons section of the marketplace, he was to input his
military ID number. This wasn't recorded by the system but just
proved that he was allowed to buy and sell weapons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The marketplace
promised to scramble all information once confirmed and entered. If
people were able to tell who was selling these items, then it would
cause a big problem for the seller. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll just use
the same one as my game.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A standard basic
tier crystal could be sold for 100 credits, an intermediate crystal
1000, and an advanced crystal 10,000 credits. Right now, he was
sitting on a gold mine. Some crystals sold for more depending on the
rarity of them or what they could be turned into. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next, he started to
search for gauntlets, there weren't as many online compared to other
weapons, but there was still plenty to choose from. He noticed that
once you moved up from basic tier weapons, the description of each
item would be quite significant. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It would tell you
what crystal was used to create the weapon suggesting that it might
have some other type of attribute other than strength. For example,
some might have fire resistance if made from a beast from a hot
planet or ice-resistant for one from a cold one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me give
you a tip.&quot; The system said, &quot;Place you're hand on the
computer and use your inspect skill while looking at the item.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn did as the
system asked and was surprised by the result. Suddenly, he could see
the stats of all the weapons that were in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The system you
are using, itself is like a computer system. It scans the information
the computer tells it and puts it into numbers for you to easily
understand. Although it will only be able to tell you if the beast
crystal is in the database. I tried my best to put as many different
beasts as I could in there, but there may be some I have never seen.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn continued to
search through the items, but something surprised him, none of them
gave the same number of stats like the one in the shop. At most, the
strength they provided was +5. While the intermediate weapon in his
system was +6. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sure it was only one
strength of difference, but right now that was a lot. The second
thing was the price of the gauntlets. They ranged from anywhere
between 6 to 8 thousand credits. This was because it included the
cost of finding all the crystals, and also paying for someone to
forge the weapon together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even the basic tier
weapons cost were around 2000 or so credits. Quinn didn't even bother
looking at any advanced tier weapons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He sat there and
started to think for a while about what to do and what was the best
option. Without a doubt, he needed a weapon before next week. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, he
finally decided, the best thing to do was to sell the advanced tier
crystal. Even though he was able to use it to create a ring that
protected him from the sun. He needed ten of the things and not only
that, it required a specific beast from a red portal planet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A place where
students just weren't allowed to go whenever they wanted. It was
basically useless to him right now, and the credits would be more
helpful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then started
to search for a Deathbat crystal on the market place hoping to figure
out what price to he could sell it at, but to his surprise, there
wasn't a single Deathbat crystal up for sale. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no clue how
much to sell it for Quinn decided to look at other specific crystals
and priced it around there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He did the base
price of the crystal plus around 2000 extra credits selling it for
12,000 in total. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And done, now
all I need to do is wait for it to be sold, then I can buy two
intermediate crystals and get the weapon form the system.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had only been a
few seconds, but someone had already put up the money for the
crystal. With it came a portal confirmation number. All Quinn needed
to do was go to the storage unit and place the crystal in the
teleporter. Once entering the confirmation number, it would teleport
the item to the user on the other end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Somewhere in a dark
room, a kid with his hair gelled backwards that looked to be a
similar age to Quinn was on his computer browsing the market place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, what
happened to that guy, I paid him good money to get that crystal for
me. I only need one more.&quot; The kid said. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He never expected to
find anything on the market place, but every day he would check just
to make sure. However, the exact crystal he was looking for turned
up. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No way! And

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no hesitation,
the boy swiped his card on the computer next to him, confirming the
purchase of the item. </FONT></FONT>

the money. The Portal delivery box confirmed that the item was real

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before doing
anything else, Quinn immediately put up the sixteen basic Rattaclaw

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It hurt him seeing

better equipment would allow him to hunt stronger beasts and earn
more money. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before heading back
to the storage room to obtain his crystals, Quinn decided to search
the marketplace a bit more to see if there was anything useful. He
also looked at the items in his shop, but they all required specific

gave him the best stats. That way if others saw the equipment, they
wouldn't think anything of it and wondered where Quinn was able to
get the money from. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was getting late
that day, and soon it would be night time. Tomorrow was the weekend,
so once again, the students would be free to do what they want as

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With this, Quinn
decided to head back to his dorm and call it a night. When he arrived
at the halls of the dorm, he could see Peter sitting up against their
room wall asleep. As Quinn walked past and entered the room, he took
a glance at Peter, who looked to be bruised and beaten. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only that, but
he seemed to have a couple of clumps of hair missing from his head. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is he still getting

more.&quot; Quinn thought as he entered the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He still hadn't
forgiven Peter, and truthfully he never thought he could. But still,
he wanted to stop incidents like this from happening in the future.
To do that, he needed to find out who was at the top giving out the
orders. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn entered
the room, Vorden was already inside on his bed relaxing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey,&quot;
Quinn said, &quot;Where have you been? I came back earlier, but no
one was here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, that,&quot;
Vorden replied. &quot;Actually, something has been really bugging me
about the whole Peter situation. It's obvious someone asked him to do
it, right? And they had already set up a fall guy to take the blame.
But when I tried to find out what happened to that person today, not
a single person knew. Everyone just kept saying the punishment was
dealt with by Duke since he's a second year.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I was
planning to do that on the weekend, but we need to be careful. If my

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you want me
to come with you?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I think
its best if we investigate separately. Plus, if I get caught its
harder for them to touch me, while for you, it's a different matter
completely until we get level on your watch sorted.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know!&quot;
Quinn said as he snapped his fingers. &quot;Why don't you ask Layla,
apparently when we left they ran into those friends of Peters.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The face Vorden was
currently making wasn't one of happiness, but it wasn't one of
disgust either. It was as if he was trying to put on a smile, but his

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then grabbed
the pillow by his side and threw it at Quinn's face. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
laid down in their bed to get some sleep. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Vorden
investigating the situation, that meant Quinn would be free to Head
to the VR room tomorrow, but before he shut his eyes to go sleep, he
decided to have a look at the tutorial video he had unlocked when
reaching level Ten. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, the
blonde man appeared, who looked like he was in some type of dojo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Congratulations
on reaching level 10, now in this video no new skills will be learnt,
but instead we will be creating our own. By now you should have also
unlocked the skill blood spray and learnt the skill Hammer strike.
Although Blood spray can be used on multiple targets, to do the most
damage its best if you are actually touching your opponent. What's
even better is if you combine the two skills together.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The blonde man then
got into a fighting stance once again, he repeated all the steps of
the Hammer strike as usual but right at the end when the force came
out, he performed the blood spray attack. Rather than spreading out
like it usually did, it was compact and came out together in a thick
line. In the video, a loud sound could be heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whoops.&quot;
The blonde man said, &quot;Looks like I will have to make some
repairs to the dojo. This move I call Hammer spray. Now be careful
because this attack will not only use up your stamina but will drain
you of your blood as well. Also, the Hammer spray takes slightly
longer to prepare, so it may not be optimal in all situations. But
the point is, if you activate blood spray with a punch in your fist,
it will be several times stronger.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After watching and
analysing the video carefully, Quinn finally shut his eyes to get
some sleep. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day when

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was glad that
after he evolved his exp points seemed to have reset. He hated to
think how hard it would be to level up if his exp kept doubling up
all the time. In fact, it seemed like an impossible task in the

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two woke up,
they started getting ready. That's when Quinn noticed something as
Vorden changed out of his uniform. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Vorden,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When leaving the

with them. Quinn was keeping his in the Dimensional void for the time

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually, most
of the time, I prefer to use elemental abilities, which kind of just
get in the way with weapons. Although you're right, I should probably
pick one just in case I get an ability where it would be useful.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hmm, I guess I
always thought Daggers were cool, but it might be a while before I
can make my own beast weapon. My family don't like to send me money
because they think I should earn everything myself.&quot; Vorden
said, laughing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had actually
planned to create a new weapon for both Vorden and Layla. They had
both helped him so much, and he wanted to return the favour. Layla
had helped him learn so much about vampires while Vorden had even
come in after him to the portal world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was also the
worry that other Vampires or something else might come to attack
them. If that was the case, they might go after those around him, so
there was no harm in making them stronger. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing just
outside the gate was Erin and Layla. Both of them were no longer in
the military uniform. They were dressed in their casual clothes for
the weekend. Layla wore a stunning red dress while Erin was a bit
more elegant. It was white in colour with flowers on the bottom, and
on top of her head, she was wearing a large summer hat to block out
the sun. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the idea hit
him, he already knew all the items needed to make the weapons. In
fact, the gauntlets he was using now only required three beats
crystals. As long as he gave the items and his original gauntlets as
a reference, a blacksmith should be able to reverse engineer and
create something similar. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Let's see, three
thousand coins for the materials, then two thousand for the
blacksmith fee. That's five thousand coins in total, then if I sell
it on the market place for eight thousand coins, that would be three
thousand in profit.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn quickly
realised the problem with his plan. The profit earned from selling
the weapons would take far too long to earn the amount he needed. He
needed to produce the items on a large scale. To do this he would
either himself need a large amount of capital in the first place or
find an investor who was interested in the idea. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would be
careful if I was you.&quot; The system said in a serious tone.
Different from its usual self. &quot;Do you remember when you
searched for the items from the shop, how none of them appeared on
the market place? Well, there's a reason for that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;These weapons
and the blueprints that were used to create them, don't belong to
humans.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't need to
hear him say the name. He knew what the system was talking about.
They belonged to the vampires. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm afraid if
you start mass-producing these items and start selling them to the
public, they will start looking for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So I guess
that rules out that plan.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I never said,
you couldn't, I just said to be careful.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, perhaps
Quinn would have to put his money making plan on hold. He still
wasn't strong enough to deal with other humans, never mind vampires,
and besides, he didn't have an investor or someone who could back him
up anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, Quinn had
arrived at the VR centre and went up to the counter. This time he
deposited 100 credits into his account so he would have ten hours of
playing time. He wasn't planning to play it at once, but this way he
wouldn't be interrupted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was early in the
morning, so there wasn't a lot of people around yet. Besides people
didn't usually want to spend their weekends playing a game all day. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked around and
then when no one was looking, opened up his dimensional void to pull
out his boots and gauntlets. He placed them both in the scanner and
when the process was finished, proceeded to put them away back in his

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After entering the
pod, he was transported to the blank white space. The first thing
Quinn tried to do was look at the ability list. He scrolled and
scrolled, but it was as he thought. The game system had no such
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He tried to use his
shadow abilities just as he had done his blood abilities. However,
this time they did not work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can the system
not record mutant cells? Is that why the abilities have to be
manually inputted?&quot; Quinn didn't really know the answer to his
own question and to be honest, not many people would, so there was no
need for him to worry about it for now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All he did know was
his blood abilities worked in the game while his shadow abilities did
not. But then there was also his new ability Daze that wasn't part of
the shadow. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before going into
matchmaking, Quinn wanted to make sure he had a hang of the new
tutorial he had been shown. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the game, it
didn't take up any of his health, and he could use his blood skills
as many times as he wanted. He watched the video one more time as a
reference before trying to perform the skill himself. On his first
try, he was quite successful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike the other
skills, there really wasn't much to learn, it was more a sense of
timing, activating his Blood spray skill at the same time as his
Hammer strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then started
to just throw out a few regular punches while activating blood spray,
only at the point where his arms would fully extend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sometimes he would
activate it too early causing his arms to jerk back a little and
sometimes he was successful. The most important thing was to get the
hang of the timing, activating it at that right point. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After practising
non-stop for around thirty minutes, his success rate of using blood
spray with his punches was around 80 percent. With hammer strike, he
could get it nearly 100 percent of the time, but like the system had
said, it took longer to charge up the hammer strike when combining it
with the blood spray. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first fight was
simply a test of everything he could do. While running, he decided to
activate the skill from the boots, increasing his speed even further

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Up in the stands,
Nate found it hard to keep his mouth closed after what he had just
seen. The last time to two of them fought each other, Nate had come
out as the winner but now looking at the new Bloodevolver, he seemed
so much stronger compared to before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But how? We
only fought a couple of weeks ago, was he holding back, or did he
really just get that much stronger in the short amount of time?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The speed, the
strength and even that weird red energy seemed stronger than before.
Nate knew he also still had the flash step and the Hammer strike in
his arsenal of skills. The more he watched this person, the more
excited he started to get. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Quinn won his
first match, he had a feeling that something was missing, but he
couldn't quite put his finger on it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah, wait a
minute, where is my exp?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before when
defeating an opponent, the system would reward him half the amount of
exp he would get for defeating a person on the outside, but this time
there was nothing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just to make sure,
Quinn quickly searched for another level one opponent. His opponent
was found, and in this match, he wasted no time in dealing with the
enemy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He dashed forward
and cast Daze stunning his opponent and at the moment used flash step
to get behind them. Then finishing the opponent off with another
standard Blood punch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Again though, there
was no system message for exp. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System, what's
the meaning of this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Seriously, do
you only like speaking to me when you have a problem.&quot; The
system replied. &quot;Anyway, this was obvious, don't you think? You
evolved, you're now a level 10, the experience needed was reset. In
simple terms your opponent was too weak for you, so the system didn't
reward you any exp.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn cursed
underneath his breath, every time he seemed to be getting somewhere
and felt like he could really make progression, the system seemed to
get in his way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then used the
search function again this time searching for level 2 ability users.
He was quickly put in another match again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time when
fighting, Quinn wanted to still finish the match fairly quickly but
was a little more cautious. He threw out a barrage of blood swipes to
distract the opponent. Then running behind his attacks, he would use
Flash step to appear behind them just in case they were able to block
the initial attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, that wasn't
needed, his blood swipe skill was now a level 2, and because his
opponent had never seen such a thing before, he tried to hit it with
his basic tier sword. As soon as the two had made an impact, his
sword had shattered. The blood swipes hit his body and sent him to
the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wasn't dead yet
but badly hurt. Then it only took one more hit to finish him off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But still, there
were no experience points. Frustrated by the situation, even more,
Quinn went to quick search for his opponent. Hoping it would find him
a random user of a higher level, that would at least give him some
experience. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he used his
inspect skill on his new opponent, he was now going up against a
level four user with an earth ability. He was wearing a full set of
basic tier equipment head to toe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the match had
started, Quinn failed to notice the stands around him were getting
filled. More people were starting to watch his games. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the last two
opponents he faced had two quick losses, they decided to inspect his
next few games. The users were able to search for the previous
opponent they played against and then inspect their matches. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had also
invited their friends saying they had met a person with a strange
ability they had never seen before. Explaining how they lost in only
a few seconds. Their friends had invited their friends, and now the
stands were filled with around twenty different people inspecting
Quinn's next match. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems
others are starting to notice you as well,&quot; Nate said as he
heard them talking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh yeah, I
remember seeing a forum post about it a few days ago on their
website. A user who used red energy. I thought It was fake though.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, we will

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looking at his
opponent, was wondering just how strong he might be. It was the first
time he was fighting against a user who wore beast equipment over his
whole body which meant he would have added stats from the equipment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually,
there was another person.&quot; The system said, &quot;But you kind
of ate him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing those words
from the system reminded him of when he was in the Bloodsucker mode,
and suddenly he felt a little strange. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thanks for

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;3…2…1..&quot;
The match had finally begun. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time though
Quinn wasn't going to charge in on the get-go. He moved forward until
he was within the five-meter range of blood swipe and swung a single
attack out as a tester. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The earth user then
stomped his foot on the ground, and a solid wall of earth rose from
the floor blocking the attack. However, the blood swipe was powerful
and managed to chip away at the wall. Seeing this, the user stomped
several times more adding to the first wall making it even thicker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, the red
lines disappeared, and the attack was stopped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was
thinking how to make his next attack and how to make it go through. A
hard earth spear had risen from behind and stabbed Quinn in the back,
causing him to stumble to the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But before Quinn
could even fully recover several more spears had risen from the
ground coming straight for him. He rolled and dodged the first few
before getting back up on his feet. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, did you
see the other guys strength? It must be because he's using a full set

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had, had
enough, he started charging forward once again. The earth user
created another wall in front of him and had done the same attack as
last time, punching the wall, causing rocks to fly out. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Matching each rock,
Quinn started to throw out a blood swipe for every rock thrown at

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Screw your

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's it,
that's the strike that was used against me!&quot; Nate said
excitedly. &quot;But I don't think it's going to be enough, why not
use some more of the red stuff to weaken the walls first. Or break
the walls to your side, which are thin and get behind him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As his fist hit the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The whole crowd was
silenced. They didn't know what to say or what they had just seen.
During the entire match, the earth user hadn't been hit once. Even
though he was wearing a full set of Beast gear, he still lost. This
would have increased his defence as well as overall strength, yet it
was useless in front of the single attack. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He knew that if he
had taken that attack head-on like he did the Hammer strike last

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although he had
performed the Blood hammer skill several times in the lobby, while in

defeating a level four ability user, the system had rewarded him for
his hard work. Although Quinn wasn't physically tired the last match

was the enormous black bags he had under his eyes. </FONT></FONT>

Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the watches
displayed up to a power level of 8, there were actually people
considered stronger than that. The system was based only on the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was it. Before
Quinn could do anything, his cover had been blown. Maybe Layla and
Vorden understood, but there was no way a stranger would understand.
Would he have to fight to the death to keep his identity a secret? Or
would he use his shadow cloak skill to hide and run away? </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You, you have
a system, my ability confirmed it, for the first time as well I was
rejected by a computer. You must be a robot with a powerful master an
ability that goes above mine. Did Richard Eno create you? That would
also explain the game. My system and the level 1 on your watch. A
robot can't have any MC points, and those attacks must be programmed
into your artificial brain!&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at little
Logan now, he just seemed like an excited little kid. He didn't seem
threatening at all, but this did put Quinn in an awkward situation.
Logan know knew he had some type of system and somehow, he confirmed
it with his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Was it better off

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought hard,

certain abilities in the game without reviling everything. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not a

ability, maybe it was a gift from a god who knows, the skills you saw
are some of the things I can do,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it an
ability similar to mine then? I wonder who did this to you. Maybe
they turned you into an Android. Android technology has come a long
way, but the use of AI systems inserted into their brain was banned.
They were afraid that an ability user may come along who could take
control of them all and use it against the army. But this is the
first time I have seen an android as powerful as yourself.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at
Logan who now wouldn't stop staring at him. Then a thought came to
his mind. He had been looking for someone who would be able to help
him out with the watch. It was clear that Logan knew a lot about
machinery and something like changing the number displayed on the
watch would be easy for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can you can
keep this a secret?&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;Maybe the two of us
can work together, perhaps find who did this to me. There are a few
things I need help with.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan was genuinely
fascinated by this ability. He had never seen anything like it
before, and the curiosity was already driving him mad. Maybe it was
even an original who was able to pass on his ability like a computer
system rather than training the person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then why did the
watch not display his level. This was why Logan could only assume
Quinn was a type of android that didn't have MC points and didn't
even realise it himself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course, it

things that stood out in the room. One of them was a large

strange situation. Layla and Vorden knew he was a vampire but didn't
know about the system. While Logan knew about the system but didn't
know he was a vampire. However, because of what Logan knew, it seemed

side. </FONT></FONT>

about your ability there going to try to take you away and dissect
you.&quot; Logan said, &quot;Well, trust me, I won't be telling the
government the military or anyone anything. I'll be honest with you
Quinn, I don't care about you, I care about the person who was able
to input a system into your mind. To find that person I need you to
lead him to me, and before that happens, I'm not letting anyone take
you away.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn decided to
think long and hard about Logan's suggestion. For him to be able to
use his ability. He needed to follow and use Vorden's plan. This way,
others wouldn't go after him. But before even that he needed everyone
to think his ability was just like everyone else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the problem was
the shadow ability was linked to the vampires. Most likely, only
vampires where able to learn this type of ability, and if that was to
be added to the game, it would cause a big problem. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went on to
explain how recently he had gone to a red portal planet along with
his friend Vorden. And while there he had discovered the ability book
and learnt the skill only to have the book disappear. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see.&quot;
Logan said, &quot;I guess I have been in my room too much I didn't
really focus on stuff going on outside. So because of your plan with
your friend you need the ability on the watch.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan sat down,

and now behind him, coffee was being made from another machine. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well how about
this, you still help me get the ability into the game but I won't
make the ability public. If you want, you can come up here and play
the game on a private server, and practice using your abilities in
the game. You won't have anyone to fight against, but you can still
use your abilities freely while no one is looking. I get to study you
a bit more, and you get to practise, it's a win-win.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There seemed to be
no downside if Quinn was to agree. The only thing was he would feel a
bit like a lab rat being looked at all the time, but this solved a
few of his problems. Before going to the portal expedition, Quinn
wanted to unlock the shadow void. That way if he was in a dangerous
situation and in the sun, he would at least have a fighting chance to
survive. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I say go for
it.&quot; The system said. &quot;If you want to unlock the Shadow

the Shadow void. This is perfect for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

have some important information for you before you head in the portal

your wrist will no longer work. It is important when entering the
portal you keep physical touch with the person next to you.
Otherwise, you will be teleported to another location.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

other travellers. The expedition is to last a week, and the goal is
to bring back as many beast crystals with you as possible. The team
with the most beast crystals at the end of the week will get the
highest score. The highest tier beast you will see in a green portal
planet is an intermediate beast. But this is rare, if you come across
one, please avoid confrontation and head to a different location.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Inside the
Shelter, there is a military base with a storage room where they will
keep track of the crystals you have obtained. I suggest you do this
at a regular interval, so you do not lose all your crystals. Our
class is the first to enter, and every hour another first-year class
will be sent. I hope this class stays competitive as your teacher.&quot;

from. It was a similar size to the old towns that human civilization

Layla said. &quot;If you look around you, most of the people here
aren't Travellers or work for the military. Most likely, all of them
were low levels who could no longer afford to live on earth. They
were forced to move here. But I bet not many have ever left this

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With power, it meant
you had more choices. A high level was able to choose which shelter
they wanted to live at and even have a place back on earth. They
could travel in between, and they weren't really restricted to
anything. However, it wasn't the same for these people, they had to
pick a place and never leave it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shelters

everyone was required to pay a credit tax for protection and to live
there. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While other shelters
were owned by companies and Factions. Most of them owned by something
known as the big four families. They were the strongest known

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With this was the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, he just

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin looked Quinn up

might be even more useless then Peter on this trip. How are you meant

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was a major
problem, although Quinn now had an ability and he could use it to
fight instead of his vampire powers, he still had the weakness of the
Vampire. The sun. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he was to fight
during the day unless he used his skill Shadow Void the sun would
still affect him. But Shadow Void took up half of his MC points not
leaving him much to fight with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other option was
to use Shadow cloak, which when he tested back at the military base
also was able to block out the sun. The problem with this was he was
unable to use his shadow abilities to attack while using shadow
cloak. It was just a stealth ability. He could use his Vampire
powers, but that would defeat the whole point. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because of these
reasons, Quinn still had to hide the shadow ability for a little
longer until he found a solution to the sun. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They did as Vorden
said, and after a couple of minutes, another group of five students
had landed in the same circle where they were. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How did you

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Although the
teleportation is random, it's not completely.&quot; Vorden said,
&quot;Think of it like a game with random respawn points. No one
knows which point you will end up at, but they can tell where all the
points are.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, where

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's head to

there or just trade in general.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They walked through
the shelter and eventually reached a very large hanger like building.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Form side to side it

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was easy to spot

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Since when

themselves will actually be helped by the military.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, there's

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group walked up

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden brought out a
single card that was gold in colour. Since the watches didn't work on

Vorden would do the same. </FONT></FONT>

hand, found it a little more difficult. When they jumped from the

again. Even when using her telekinesis ability, her arrow was too

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While thinking about
whether or not to Blood Layla, Quinn decided he would leave it to her
and would ask her later. At a time when the sun wasn't out. If she
became a vampire or something similar, she would have the same
weakness as Quinn right now, and that wouldn't be good for the
situation they were in. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not all beasts were
hostile, but the Teethworms were definitely that. The slightest
vibrations would cause them to react, thinking food was nearby,
springing upon its prey and attacking them. Although there were quite
a few in number, they didn't have the hindsight to attack together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike like the
Rattaclaws which were more difficult to deal with. The level of beast
didn't generally mean how strong it was but how strong of a crystal
was produced inside its body. There were some basic tiers stronger
than others, and this was the same as you went up a tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although it was
unlikely a basic tier at any strength could match the weakest of an
intermediate tier. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the group was
busy fighting away on the outside, one of the worms managed to wiggle

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it! That

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay,&quot;
Quinn replied. As soon as the worm had reached the shade of the
umbrella, Quinn grabbed the worm mid-air by the end of its tail. It
continued to wiggle around stretching its body trying to bite at
whatever it was in front of it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So ugly,&quot;
Quinn said as he squeezed it tightly with his bare hands. The centre
of its body was strung like a towel as black blood fell to the floor.
</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As long as Quinn
stayed underneath the shade of his umbrella, he was at full strength
no matter what came after him. For something as simple as a weak
basic tier beast like a Teethworm, he could deal with it just using
one hand. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As expected, just
like how the system no longer gave him experience points for fighting
low levels in the game. It was now the same for basic tier beasts.
Before Quinn would be awarded a 100 exp per kill now, it was only ten

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, there was
some good news. It was the first time he had levelled up since
becoming a full vampire, and he was now receiving two stat points
instead of one. He wasn't sure if this was the case if he levelled up
again, but it wouldn't make sense if it wasn't. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, Quinn
decided to put one stat point into his stamina, as he did, he felt a

stat. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although half a
second didn't sound like a long time. Quinn realised when using it in
the game how useful it actually was in a fight. The second reason was
because he wasn't sure if there was any way he could increase his
charm points other than through the free stats. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Was this here
before?&quot; Peter said, staring at the thing. The next thing he
knew out from the mound of sand another Teethworm came jumping out.
All panicked Peter fell to the floor, and completely forgot about the
earth staff he held on his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But before the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I knew I would

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you,&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter wasn't a
horrible fighter. He had training from Vorden when the two of them
were still friends and learnt all the basics. If it was a one on one
fight with an easy basic tier beast like the worm, then he should
have dealt with it fine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But his mind was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right by the oasis
another group had witnessed the whole thing and couldn't help but
laugh at Peter's reaction. They were a group of five from a different
class. The leader of the group was named Ben, and he wielded a large
club on his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After having a good

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah and there

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He reached out for
the club on his back and was ready to slam the thing to pieces.

it through its body and into the sand. It wriggled about for a few

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While students where

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they entered,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The cost of living

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two people
Vorden was talking about was, of course, Peter and Quinn. To be
honest, Quinn wanted to go to the red zone too. Most likely the
Wingedlizard lived there, but he had planned to go there when the day
cycle had changed too night. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could use his

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was also the

the group as well. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought of
that too.&quot; Erin said.&quot; As you can see on the map, there is
a safe zone just outside of the red area. Most likely it's a
territory where two different beasts clash, so they don't cross each
other's path. The two can wait there while we go inside and attack.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing Erin's

him and Peter alone then perhaps Quinn could sneak off at some point
to hunt the Wingedlizards on his own. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group then went
to rest for the night. They slept well as it was a tough night for

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about it, if trouble comes our way, I have a trick up my sleeve to
fight them off,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;You see that building up
ahead, it looks like an abandoned well of some sought. We will wait

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving, out
of Peter's large rucksack, they handed Layla a few food pills and
bottles of water that was placed in Layla's small bag. It would be
just enough for them while they were away out hunting and if they
needed some more, one of them could always come back and get some
from Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Boss, it looks

to the Red zone. Who should we follow?&quot; One of the men said to

with all those bigshots at the Red zone. It was never our intention
anyway. I managed to do some research on their group yesterday. It
turns out that their group had two Level 5 powers users and wait for
it… Two-level ones if you can believe it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, now it
makes sense why they have split off from the group. They would
probably get in the way if they were to fight. If we take their
crystals they got yesterday, then we will climb up from the bottom of
the leader board. We should be able to finish off at a decent
position for the test.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back at the red

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The red zone was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A trail of ice
started to form across the floor, eventually trapping the lizard's

to move. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Either shut up

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before doing
anything drastic, the group wanted to test out Vorden's new fire
abilities. They did same as before with Layla drawing out one of the
lizards and then Erin freezing the lizard's movements. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they were
ready, Vorden shot out a stream of fire from the palm of his hands.
The beast screamed and howled in pain. After a few second the beast
caught on fire and Vorden no longer had to supply it with energy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this moment, Berg
had just turned the corner and witnessed the whole thing. His mind
was going crazy with thoughts. Did someone outside of the family know
how to use the fire abilities? If that was the case, they needed to
get rid of him, before anyone else knew or found out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Erin was busy
carving out the beast to find its crystal, a fireball was spotted
coming towards them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look out!&quot;
Layla shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the last second,
Vorden turned his head and fired a fireball of his own equal in size.
As the two fireballs clashed a small explosion was created, and
sparks of flame flew out onto the sound. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You must be
dealt with, no one is allowed to learn the secrets of the flame!&quot;
Berg shouted. Shooting out fire from the palm of his hands, he was
able to propel himself forward while running, making him move at an
incredible speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden readied his
self planning to fight back with anything Berg would use. If Berg
shot out a fire ball, Vorden would retaliate with the same. If Berg
shot out a stream of fire or made a pillar of fire, then Vorden would
do the same only better. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was how Vorden
had won all his fights before. His experience when it came to
fighting, was able to outmatch those that knew their own abilities
inside and out. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then at the last
second, Berg propelled himself into the air. Stream of fire was seen
coming from the bottom of his hands and feet. It looked almost like
he was flying in the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Spinning flame
kick.' Using one of his legs, the fire would shoot out from the back
of his heel, causing him to spin. Then with the other leg would let
out multiple blades of fire. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it, I
can't do that!&quot; Vorden shouted. As the blades of fire were
coming towards them, Vorden lifted both hands, creating a small wall
of fire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Vorden thought he
was safe, though, he was wrong. As the blades of fire touched the
wall, it ripped right through and continued to go past. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By now, Layla and
Erin had long moved to the side and become spectators of the whole
thing, and the same could be said for Berg's teammates as well. It
was clear that all of is attacks were aimed at a single person, and
he didn't care for the rest of the team. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is going
on?&quot; Erin asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know,
but I do know Vorden knows how to annoy a load of people, perhaps
this is just one of them,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All though Vorden's
flame wall was useless, he was able to see the point of when the
flames would touch the wall. For they would slightly part away apiece
of his wall just before the blades of fire touched. This gave him
enough time to dodge every single one of the blades coming at him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This guy is

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second Berg
landed on the ground he dashed forward using the flames once again to
propel him. Vorden fired fire ball after fire ball, but then Berg
just covered his hands in flames and would knock them away. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then with his hands
covered in flames, he went for a punch towards Vorden's face. Vorden
could see the punch coming towards him. When it came to hand to hand
combat, he was skilled and had years of experience as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could see it
coming and was planning to duck, but suddenly, the fist sped up in an

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden laid on the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Vorden was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Berg had the ability
to produce fire from any part of his body. The clothes he was wearing
were specially designed by his family so they wouldn't burn away. As
the last second, before the fist was to hit Vorden, he had produced a
strong flame from his elbow pushing his fist forward and giving it an
extra boost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was used to
elemental abilities but had never come across the fire one before. It
was an original ability, unlike Ice, wind, earth and water. However,
none of these acted like the flames which came from the body itself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the destructive

head was facing the floor. From the top of his head, a trickle of
blood was dripping down onto his forehead, and little by little
droplets would fall to the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why is the
boss just standing there?&quot; Lippy asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The truth was Berg
couldn't explain it himself. Something about the person he was facing
a few seconds ago had suddenly changed. He felt the same presence as
when he was just about to face one of the elders in his own family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then for the first
time since being beaten to the floor, Vorden had moved. He lifted his
hand and wiped the blood away before staring at it on his sleeve. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You guys said
you would protect me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, don't
look at me Sil,&quot; Raten said, &quot;Vorden was the one who got
knocked out before I could even do anything.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe it's
time for a change?&quot; Sil said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, and
leave this person in charge!&quot; Vorden argued. &quot;If you do
this, you will be lonelier than before, even Quinn won't stay by your
side!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn. Ah yes,
Quinn.&quot; Sil said as he looked around at where he was. &quot;I
don't see any Quinn?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This will be
good.&quot; Raten said, &quot;Hey Sil, that man in front of you is
hiding Quinn from us.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sil then looked at
Berg up and down and started to walk towards him, but his face wasn't
peaceful or anything. It was like that of a demon. The anger could be
felt, the emotion, everything. Berg could feel it just coming from
his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stay back!&quot;
Berg shouted as he covered his forearms and fist in flames once
again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Sil took another
step forward, Berg was at his limit and knew, he needed to attack
now. Placing both hands together, he started to fire a pillar of
flames from his hand like a flamethrower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the fire came
towards him, Sil swung his hands, lifting a pile of sand with it and
dropping it straight on the flames causing it to extinguish. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When did he
get my ability?&quot; Layla said, watching the fight. &quot;And why
is it stronger than mine? I could never lift that amount of sand.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden's
ability is strange,&quot; Erin said. &quot;But if I remember
correctly, he could control two abilities. Perhaps it has something
to do with that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Berg
too was shocked. He had thought Vorden was just someone who had
learnt the family secret. Maybe tortured one of their members into
teaching it to them. But now suddenly, he was using another ability.
How was this possible? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Berg was
shocked by the whole thing, he started to feel an icy presence climb
up from his feat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this?&quot;
He said as he saw his two legs freezing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In an instant, he
activated the fire to cover his legs causing it to melt the ice, but
all Sil wanted to do was stall him for a second or so, as he formed
an ice spear and threw it directly at his shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It landed and
pierced Berg, but he couldn't complain long as pillars of fire were
already rising from the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He has your
ice abilities as well!&quot; Layla said, &quot;That's three
abilities, just how strong is Vorden really!?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While using one hand
to cast pillars of fire the other hand would continue to throw ice
spears. Berg could only dodge these two attacks for so long. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, he
has to be running out of MC soon!&quot; Berg said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the black
room, Raten was busy laughing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I bet you this
guy thinks he can win the match as long as he waits for Sil to tire
out. Well, that's not happening.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, Vorden
contained three abilities. Whenever he copied a person's ability, he
also copied the amount of MC points in their body. This was also the
same for all the other abilities he stored inside his body. But
Vorden's ability and cells were unique. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As long as he had
copied an ability, he would be able to change any of the MC cells
into whatever type he wanted. Using the fire ability was a level 8
ability, Erin's ability was a level 5, and Layal's ability was a
level 2. This meant he had a huge amount of MC points to use, and if
he wanted to like earlier, he would be able to change all his cells
into one type of MC. Which was why Sil was able to lift the sand to
take out the fire. While Layla would have never been able to achieve
something like that with her ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the fight
continued, Berg could tell that Vorden wasn't tiring out. He needed
to act fast. As fire came from his right and Ice came from his left.
Berg crouched into a fetal position and started to let the fire build
up inside him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when the
attacks were right by his side, he expanded his limbs and out came a
sphere of fire, getting rid of all the attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now Berg was
panting and sweating hard. It was a last-ditch effort to protect
himself, but he really didn't know what to do after this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where.. is...
Quinn?&quot; Sil asked as he walked over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla and Erin were
too far to hear any of the words Vorden had spoken. But were worried
that he might do something drastic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Crazy boy, I
beg you don't do something crazy!&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Vorden shouted. &quot;Raten was lying, Quinn is safe he's somewhere
else, let me take over, and I can show you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You damn Rat
Vorden!&quot; Raten shouted back. &quot;Now I'm going to get my assed
handed to me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now Vorden had
finally reached where Berg was standing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't want
to make an enemy of you, but you attacked us first,&quot; Vorden
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly the feeling
Berg once had, now was gone. When he looked at Vorden, it was the
same as before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm from the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Berg had
heard Vorden's second name, he finally understood. The Blade family
weren't as big as the big four, but that was because they chose not
to be. They were a secretive family that didn't choose to have much
influence in the world. Because of this, not many knew about them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Berg didn't really

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Berg placed his head
in the ground and started to apologise. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden thought about
it for a while. He hated to use his family name like this, but he was
sure at least the big four would know of it, but while he was using
it, he might as well take advantage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay, but
I'm going to have to have you hand over your crystals you got today

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Erin, Layla
and the others watched this scene, they couldn't believe what was
happening. They knew Vorden was an original, they even knew of his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about that, I think it's best if we head back and hand these crystals
in to be counted towards our score and I'm a little worried about
Peter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But aren't
those crystals useless?&quot; Layla asked. &quot;Most of them have
already been counted.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each crystal inside
had a unique pattern to it. Every single crystal was unique, similar
to a human fingerprint. When the crystals are counted, they are
placed into a machine that assigns a certain code to each crystal.
These unique codes are then added onto the teams score board. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once crystals were
counted, students were able to do what they wanted with the crystals.
Sell them for credits, turn them into beast gear or even trade with
them. But what they weren't allowed to do during this assessment,
were buy Beast crystals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The whole shelter
was under strict instructions to not sell any beast crystals to any
students. This was to avoid a group from buying crystals and
registering them under their points. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I guess
you guys don't know.&quot; Vorden said, &quot;My brother did the same
thing 2 years ago, so I have a little bit of insider information, I
guess. Although the same crystals can no longer be registered for
points. If the crystals belong to another team. The unique codes from
their score will go onto ours. So while there score would drop, ours
would rise.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This information was

originals like Vorden knew of it, or those who had already registered
with the military. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well I hate to

this was defiantly one of them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, while we
are ahead, why don't we keep on hunting?&quot; Erin asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The truth is
I'm worried about Peter. Because of this, he might be targeted.&quot;
Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you knew
about this, then why didn't we leave him at the shelter?&quot; Erin
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If we did, it
would just be the same result. Perhaps even more so, people would
attack him as soon as they saw him on the street.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was acutely a
second reason why Vorden and Quinn wanted to bring Peter along. They
were hoping to draw out whoever Peter was afraid of. Peter seemed
pretty sure that someone was going to attack them on this expedition
and if so, Vorden and Quinn thought they could find some answers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No one would
attack a fellow student like that are you crazy. I understand when
the second years attacked you.&quot; Erin said. &quot;You were the
one who attacked them, but why would they just randomly attack
another student inside the shelter. Even if it meant getting their
crystals, no human being would just attack another because of the
test. and even so, people would rush over to help him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that point,
Vorden and Layla looked at each other, and both of them had the same
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Erin, you do
know that Peter is a level 1, right?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What does that
have to do with anything?&quot; She replied back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was as the two
had thought. Erin was unaware of the treatment that lower Levels
received compared to everyone else. The truth was, Vorden and Layla
already knew this to some degree. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most of the students
at the school who were midrange levels didn't experience much of the
bad side, and this was true for Erin as well. The two knew this was
the case, many of the students were just unaware of what happened.
But they just didn't realise that Erin was one of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin herself never
mistreated low levels, but just never paid them any attention either.
She had one goal, and getting to know them wouldn't allow her to
achieve anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the three of them
started to head back to where the well was. The two of them began to
explain to Erin just what really happened at the school. But not only
at the school but what happened on the outside world as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But the strong
would never steal form the weak,&quot; Erin said. &quot;Just what
does that prove? We already know we are stronger than them. Wouldn't
it make more sense to fight against those that are stronger than your
selves and try to improve as a person? Just what is there to gain
from all of this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin just couldn't
comprehend why certain people would choose to do such things. In the
situation with Vorden and Berg, she could understand. The two of them
had battled it out and had a grand duel. The loser Berg, had gifted
Vorden with the crystals as a prize. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But neither group

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Every person
is different,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;Honestly if we knew all the

be in the situation we are in right now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The wind user was
trapped inside the wall of shadows, but it was a strange feeling. It
wasn't like he couldn't move, but instead, if he tried moving his
movements would be incredibly slow, like he was stuck in some type of
glue. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In his panic, he had
completely forgotten about his ability. With his mind now thinking
straight, he used his hand to cast a wind blade cutting a piece of
the shadow. It quickly separated and then started to reform again in
almost an instant. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The moment the
student had cut the shadow with his wind ability, Quinn's MC had
decreased. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It also seemed that
while Shadow Void was active, he would be unable to gain back his MC
points like he initially thought, which meant he had to be even more
conservative if he was planning to use his shadow abilities along
with the shadow Void. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But just like when
he used shadow control on his own shadow, whenever the shadow was
attacked, his MC points would lower slightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student cast
wind slash after wind slash and was slowly able to move more. Then
finally, he was free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I did it!&quot;
he shouted, but when he looked up, Quinn was there right in front of
him. He grabbed both arms of the wind user and twisted them inward,
so his palms were facing towards his own face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn kicked
both feet of the user, causing him to fall to his knees and once
again the shadow had grabbed onto his legs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the elemental
user, the ability to control the elements came from their hands and
feet. This was different for fire and some other elements. But this
fact was true for the basic ones. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm s... so...
sorry!&quot; The wind user said with a stutter. &quot;It was all
Ben's idea, he said that we would be able to take care of you level
ones and take your crystals, add it to our team's points.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The wind user was
deadly frightened; not only had he never seen such a strange ability
before, he was still trying to decide if the person in front of him
was human. It seemed like he was a person with multiple abilities. He
could control the shadow, shoot out red aura from his hands and on
top of that, he had supernatural healing, and now with the wind
users' arms twisted, he felt like he had superhuman strength as well.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This ben, does

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I mean, we all

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn couldn't be a
hundred percent sure if he were telling the truth or not. But judging
by his reaction and how frightened he was, Quinn felt like his words
were true. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know if
you increased your charm stat a bit more, you would be able to get
these weak minded people to tell you anything.&quot; The system said.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
kidding me?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, there are
certain skills in your system that will only unlock once you get
enough stat points. One of them is a type of mind control for the
Charm stat. It's quite handy, if their mind is weak, you can replace
their memories, get them to spill the beans or even if it was really
high, you could even get the person to kill themselves. Of course,
that would only be for the very top of Vampire classes.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like the
charm stat was becoming more and more dependable. At first, Quinn
thought it was just an annoyance that only allowed him to get girls,
but that didn't seem to be the case anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
how many points in charm I need to unlock this skill?&quot; Quinn
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ten points are
needed for the influence skill.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, Quinn and
gained 20 exp, for defeating the level three student and 40 exp
points for defeating the level four student. Then there was also the
two daily mission he completed bringing him up to 140 exp. Even if he
did defeat the wind user in front of him, that would only bring his
experience points up to 160. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wouldn't be
enough to level up. When using his inspect skill at the two around
him, one was blood A type while the other two were blood O. The blood
O stat allowed him to put a point into anything he wished. Still, he
was unsure whether that included the charm stat or not, but it was
likely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But even then, he
would only have 8 points in his Charm stat. He needed 10. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason why Quinn
was so adamant about unlocking this skill after hearing about it from
the system, was because he didn't know what to do. The three users
here were from the same school as him, and they had seen his ability,
it would have been fine if it was just the shadow ability, but they
had also seen his blood abilities as well and his incredible healing.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he could, he
wanted to avoid killing his fellow students, but it was something
that would have had to be done. In the end, they were the ones who
attacked him, and it was a secret he couldn't afford to be let out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But could he really
do it, technically he had killed already but back then he wasn't sane
of mind. Quinn would even argue that it wasn't really him but
something else controlling him. But killing someone while he was
fully sane was another thing altogether. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, from the
corner of his eye. Quinn saw something forming from the ground. The
sharp object shot out like a bullet and Quinn managed to move his
head and doge at the last second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, heavy
breathing sounds could be heard. When Quinn looked at the wind user
in the shadow wall, he could see that an earth spike had impaled
right through the wind user's neck. Blood was flowing down the spike
as the student struggled to breathe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>More spikes started
to appear from the floor, and when Quinn looked ahead, he could see
that the earth user had regained consciousness and was barely
standing on his feet with his hand held out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Die you

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking about the
spike, Quinn felt like he had just avoided death. Sure he had plenty
of health points remaining, but if the spike had impaled him through
the head, he was pretty sure he wouldn't have been able to recover
from something like that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You just tried

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Humans are truly
disgusting!' Quinn thought. For some reason, he thought if he could
change maybe, they could too. They were still young, and only
students, they had time to change their ways. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In a fit of anger,
Quinn sent out blood swipe after blood swipe. The earth user tried to
raise a wall between them, but the wall was far too weak. The second
the blood swipes made an impact, the wall was smashed, and the blood
strikes continued to hit the user. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden and the
others started to make their way through the dry, harsh desert. They
didn't encounter many beasts on their way back. It seemed like the
desert beasts were much more of a territorial creature. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Rubble from one of
the buildings could be seen everywhere but what shocked him most, was
Peter. He was crawling across on the ground towards them. His legs
had been hurt and possibly a few of his ribs broken. The only thing
he was using was his forearms to crawl along the floor towards them. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, what

by his side. But Peter continued to move forward using his forearms

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have…. to&quot;
Perter mumbled. &quot;I have to get back those crystals. Otherwise,
those guys will hate me. I can't live anymore.&quot; Peter said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

had come to a halt as his hands seemed to hit something. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, you've

on his shoulders. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was
half-conscious the whole time, yet there was one thing in his mind
keeping him going forward. He had dealt with the gruesome pain of
being tortured, but he couldn't deal with everyone hating him. He
realised now that back then, he had chosen the wrong decision, and he
wanted to change that. He wanted to change himself. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others hated
him, so what, because he hated himself even more. But when he had
heard Vorden's words, something in his mind had clicked and he had
snapped out of his half-dazed state. He looked up and could see
Vorden bent over in front of him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I guess
it was pretty clear what happened then,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait a minute,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, it's not
like we can ask Peter what happened,&quot; Erin replied. &quot;They
probably took him away too.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although it was
possible, the other two doubted it. Both of them knew before heading
out to this expedition that Quinn had the shadow ability as well as
his blood abilities. It sounded like if there was ever an emergency
in the sun, he was pretty confident about fighting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unless the group
that attacked them were high levels, they just couldn't see Quinn
losing in a fight. Vorden also believed that it was unlikely to be a
group of high levels. Otherwise, they would have confronted them
without waiting for Peter to separate from them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Was it perhaps one
of the group of people working for the second years, no they wouldn't
hurt Peter like this. Even if he refused to work for them, they would
probably kill him in case he told anyone, but instead, they left him
alive.' Vorden thought. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out from the bag,
Erin had pulled out a little first aid box. It looked to be made of
metal like a small briefcase and had a small standard red cross on
it. Then she placed it on the ground and pressed the red cross. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The little Robot
then scouted off and started to scan the area until it had eventually
found Peter injured on the ground. It started a scan and brought out
small tools patching up Peter wherever it could. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Will he be
okay after this?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He should be,
that Robot can deal with some pretty serious injuries. It's like
having a personal doctor with you.&quot; Erin replied. &quot;. As
long as he isn't near death, he should be fine. But I do have to warn
you guys, we only have one of those things. Once the medicine has
been used to treat any infections and such, it doesn't really have
the supplies to treat us again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm surprised
you actually let Peter use it then.&quot; Said Layla. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin didn't actually
want to use such a precious item on Peter. She felt like it was
useless. Peter would eventually heal on his own anyway, this would
just speed up the process. But after hearing the words of the others
and seeing Peter in pain like that. It made her realise that perhaps
the others weren't exaggerating about the mistreatments of others. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you think
that's them, probably one of them using their abilities,&quot; said
Vorden. &quot;It doesn't look too far away, and we can get our

Quinn?&quot; Layla replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why don't we
split up?&quot; Vorden suggested. &quot;We can't just leave Peter out
here, I'll stay with him in case anything happens. When he's all
healed up, we'll go looking for Quinn. You two can go get our
crystals back, but if it looks too tough, then fall back and come to
the Well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla didn't like
the sound of Vorden being the one to rescue Quinn, but it seemed like
the only thing they could really do. If Layla was to go out on her
own and a powerful beast appeared, she could get seriously hurt. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They could send Erin

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is that?&quot;
Layla asked. For the first time, Erin didn't seem like her confident
self. In fact, Layla had never seen her back down from a challenge.
Even when Vorden was facing off against one of the big four. Although
she said she was weaker, she had never displayed a hint of fear. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

herself and shivering in the desert heat. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Mommy please

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that the

It had appeared many times in many textbooks as they grew up.

wasn't as rich as you can probably imagine, but they wanted us to
have a good life. They saved up every little bit of credits they
could and they finally managed to purchase a level three ability book
for my sister, just before sending her off to the military. She was
the hope of our family and they wanted her to become a decent
traveller. But in her second year of military school, she died on an
expedition. It was a big shock to us all, but it was an even bigger
shock for my parents. It seemed like their life started spiralling
down from there. There was no way they could afford another ability
book for me. They told me not to worry, not to try and work hard like
my sister for fear I would perish as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

the power in the attack it lifted both of its arms to protect itself,
and it placed its arms in an X-shape right in front of its face. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The lines of power

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's see how

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's shadow
ability was nearly a perfect counter to the Dalki. The enormous

everyone's morale was increased, for the first time they had a
glimmer of hope again, when they saw the mighty Dalki fall to the

only had one thought on their mind. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla looked at the

be concerned about. As long as Quinn had a steady supply of blood, he
would be fine, but right now, something was holding him back from

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now that was

were now on full display, they were a little strange compared to
regular human teeth. It looked like those of a crocodile, each tooth
was razor sharp and they overlaid one another. </FONT></FONT>

to walk over to where Quinn was, something strange was happening on
its back. The single spike on its back started to pulsate and glow

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Dalki then
turned its head slowly using its strength and saw Vorden standing
there. &quot;The boy from earlier, but how did he get so strong. He

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next thing Layla
did, she didn't even bother asking for Erin's permission, she grabbed
one of the arrows from her quiver and used the tip to make a small

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had to be
absolutely sure not to get a hit from the Dalki. Not only were his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whith Quinn's new
attack, combining his shadow control with the blood swipe, had hit
the Dalki's body. It had shattered and disappeared just as his normal
blood swipe would. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Combining his shadow
skills with his blood skills allowed him to create a more powerful
combination skill. Connecting the shadow to his blood swipe allowed
him to also add his own strength to the power of the blood swipe. The
shadow made it possible for the attack to be flexible, moving it
about freely. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This would also add
extra force and momentum into the attack making it more powerful and

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were only two
problems Quinn still had to find a solution for. If the shadow
holding the blood swipe was hit, or if he wasn't fast enough, the
blood swipe would escape from the shadow's grasp. The other problem
is that when the attack hit it would disappear, so he could only use
it once. Of course, using the shadow for an attack also used MC
points, but there was nothing he could about that. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And Quinn did just
that, this time casting a Blood swipe up in the air before grabbing
it with his shadow. He then swung it from above right down on top of
the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The attack was a

forearms were dripping with green blood, but it ignored its wounds.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, even
Quinn was starting to worry, his attacks were clearly working, but
the Dalki was acting in a strange way. For now, there was nothing he
could do about it. He went to attack once again with his shadow

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You seem to

but to move his shadow to block the fist-attack, but the Dalki

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The same goes
for me. He must have started moving towards Quinn as soon as he saw
the Dalki,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;But why did this happen after
what we were just talking about? You had a family that cared for

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's quite
noble of you. A society should build itself on sacrificing the weak
ones to preserve the strong.&quot; That's exactly how the Dalki does
it. He was selfless, and his sacrifice allowed the stronger human
genes to be passed on. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This was it,' Quinn
thought. As the Dalki came closer to him, he had run out of trump
cards. His MC had been used and all he had left was his original
skills. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Opening both palms,
Quinn soon ran forward. When he felt that he was close enough, he
shot out a blood spray from one hand. The Dalki would slightly flinch
in response to this as his foot shifted back a little. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, these
attacks wouldn't inflict any damage. But although he got stronger the
more he was hurt, that didn't mean his defence increased. He had been
quite severely damaged by Quinn's Shadow Scythe attacks. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another spray of

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But in contrast to
Layla's words, Vorden wasn't too sure. He didn't know how Quinn's
attacks worked for he hadn't told the two. Also, he wasn't sure if he
was imagining things or not, but every time Quinn used that attack,
his face seemed to grow paler. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look. I know
what Peter did against you two was wrong, but can't you just forgive
him?&quot; Layla shouted back in response to Vorden's words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden shook his

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're
mistaken, Layla. I already forgave Peter a while ago. I'm just saying
this for his sake,&quot; he soon said. &quot;Look at him, he's in
pain. He's been bleeding for the last two minutes, and at most, he
only has another three before he's completely gone. It'll be more
peaceful to get rid of him now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the group didn't
have time to decide for they were distracted by something else.
Whenever Quinn would use the blood spray, a sound similar to a small
shotgun would be heard, but the sound had suddenly stopped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they looked
over, they saw Quinn kneeling down on one knee while the Dalki was
still standing, but green blood was oozing from the multiple wounds
on his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn hadn't paid
much attention to it, but he had unfortunately run out of stamina.
With the increase of firepower in the blood spray, it also took up
more energy to use it. Right now, it seemed that he had overexerted
himself. Sweat was dripping all over his body while all of his
muscles cramped up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked at the

after it had received so much damage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Dalki soon
started walking over while Quinn looked at it directly in the eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And just like that,
the last thing he could do had been tossed out the window. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it! If
Peter can go forward, then at least I can as well!&quot; Vorden
shouted all of a sudden as he charged in with what little power he
had left, but all of a sudden, a large metallic object went flying
right by Vorden's head, landing directly between Quinn and the Dalki.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You kids get
back! Get out of here now! That's an order!&quot; This sound echoed
from the object that just landed, and all of them found out what it
was straight away. It was a mech. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly soon after,
another Mech had landed right next to that one. It did not take for
the Dalki and the mechs to be engaged in combat after that. The mechs
had humungous strength and were equivalent to that of the Dalki they
were currently facing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only problem
was, they were still clunky and not as agile, but the others noticed
that it would take a while before the Dalki was able to destroy them.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come, Quinn!&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And with that, the
two of them went over to where the others were by Peter's side. Right
now, his face was much paler than before, and not to mention, his
eyelids were drooping as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside a near pitch
black training hall, a certain boy was creeping his way forward
towards a door. He stood just outside the entrance, then he stuck his
head through the door and peeked into the room, looking around to see
if anyone could spot him. And just hovering above him was something
that looked like a miniature bull, a little larger than a human's
fist. Although this one also had tiny wings and two large fangs on
the front of his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you spot
anyone Ham?&quot; The kid asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, but are
you really sure we should be doing this, you could get kicked out of
the family?&quot; The little flying bull replied, fluttering around
in the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As if that
could ever happen. My dad's one of the thirteen family leaders, and
I'm the one that's going to be his successor.&quot; The boy then
walked into the large hall with Ham following in the air closely
behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his gelled back
black hair and his dark clothing it was nearly impossible to spot him
at night, but there was one distinctive thing that stood out about
the boy, it would allow you to see him in the dark even if you were
quite a distance away. It was his glowing red eyes, which gave the
boy away as a vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His name was Fex,
and today he had come to the hall inside his family's castle for one
reason, to go to the human world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On his back, he
carried a relatively large backpack, packed with all sorts of things.
Clothes, toothpaste, a brush and all sorts of essentials. After all,
he didn't know how long he would be visiting the human world for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then out of his
backpack, Fex pulled a small silver ring which had ten crystals embed
on the inside and all around. He lifted the ring into the air before
kissing it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have to
thank you again Blood evolver wherever you are, because of you I can
finally leave this place.&quot; He then placed the ring on the ring
finger of his right hand and was finally ready to go. &quot;Come on
Ham, hurry up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, I think
I hear someone!&quot; Ham said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Ham said it,
the sound of footsteps could be heard. Fex quickly looked around the
hall which was filled with square-shaped machinery on the floor, each
spaced an equal distance from each other, the gap between each one
was quite far. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly rummaging
through his backpack, Fex pulled out what looked like a piece of
paper. &quot;Come on, where is it, I need to remember that access
code!&quot; But the nerves were getting the better of him, and his
fingers fumbled as he dropped the piece of paper onto the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex there
right there!&quot; The bull said now visibly sweating. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, let's
just hope I don't end up somewhere too bad!&quot; Fex then rushed
over to one of the square machines on the floor and tapped on top of
the machine. A bright display lit up, asking for an access code. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please input
the correct access code for your destination.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He closed his eyes
and tried to remember one of the numbers form the piece of paper, but
he struggled to remember which one led to where. In the end, he had
to just go for it and type in the only one he could think of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The contraption
started to open, and mechanical sounds could be heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From the hallway,
one of the guards who was roaming could hear the mechanical sounds
coming from the room. 'Is someone using the teleporters, I don't
remember an outing planned for today?' The man thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He quickly ran into
the room, and just then, he could see Fex standing in front of the
circular teleport device. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex what are
you doing? Don't go in!&quot; the man shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex turned around
and looked up at the man, he gave him a huge smile before saluting
the man. He grabbed Ham and jumped backwards into the teleport
circle. Once Fex had gone through, the machine had automatically
closed down on its own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I knew that
kid always did crazy things, but this has just gone too far.&quot;
The man said. &quot;I must report this to the family leader
immediately.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, inside
the teleporter, Fex mind was being distorted, and all he could see
around him was a bright array of different colours. &quot;Ham, you
need to transform, the humans will have a fit if they see you flying
above me!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A small puff of
black smoke appeared around Ham. When the black smoke went away, it
was replaced with what looked like a black dangling earing, it was
round at the top with a little symbol of a bull on it. In contrast,
the dangling bit was long and rectangular on the bottom. Fex quickly
grabbed it before putting it on his right ear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Finally, here
I come, bye dark gloomy world!&quot; Fex yelled excitedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then the tunnel
of colours around him seemed to end, and now something felt like it
was dragging him through to the other side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex had opened
his eyes, he found himself in a large dome-like building with digital
signs going all across the walls showing all sorts of advertisements.
But the biggest one of them all was one that said welcome to Toklon
City. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I finally made it.'
Fex thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was currently
inside what was known as a City station on Earth. In the centre of
the city was a large circular device that glowed a bright white
colour and every so often people would appear from it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Several different
people were coming through, some wearing building equipment, others
in suits, and some were even travellers wearing beast gear. City
stations could usually be found on most shelters on other planets,
large factions also owned them as well as the top corporations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were two types
of city stations, an arrival station and a departure station. The
departure stations were usually filled with all types of checks. Even
those that were privately owned would receive regular check-ups form
the human federation, they would even send their own guys to work as
security. If it didn't meet a certain standard, then it would simply
be put out of commission. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And of course, at
each of these stations was an access code that needed to be imputed.
This access code was usually given to only a couple of people who
worked at city stations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex couldn't help
but stare around and look in amazement at the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can you
believe it Ham!&quot; Fex said. &quot;We made it, and there are so
many humans. They look nearly the same as us, although there are some
incredibly ugly ones.&quot; Fex said a little too loud. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The people around
him started to give Fex strange looks as they heard him say those
words, but at the same time, they couldn't help staring at him.
Although he was a teenage boy who looked around sixteen, they could
feel a certain charm pulling them in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex, you need
to suppress your abilities,&quot; Ham said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh that's
right, I nearly forgot!&quot; Fex closed his eyes and focused,
letting the aura that was surrounding his body shrink inside himself.
Suddenly the people who were looking at him no longer felt an urge to
stare.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike the departure
station, the arrivals station didn't have much security checks, apart
from a few guards who stood by the doors to the exit. After all the
checks were done on the other end and only when they sure it was
safe, would the access code be inputted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were also
several people that seemed to be waiting for their loved ones. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex headed for the
exit as if he didn't have a worry in the world, but just as he
reached the exit, he could see the doors to the outside where the sun
was glaring. &quot;Time to put this ring to the test,&quot; Fex said.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He closed his eyes
and took one step out into the open sun, and nothing happened. There
was no itching feeling or burning pain like when he had gone through
his training. It was just the same as when he was in the dark. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With a big smile on
his face, he continued to walk forward and started to explore the
city. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From the city
station, he was able to see the edge far away in the distance. The
city was surrounded by a large wall that was nearly taller than all
the skyscrapers around them. On the buildings, there were also
several advertisements for different things but what he kept seeing
the most, where either companies selling ability books or those that
were recruiting travellers to join their faction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After walking a
while, Fex decided to stop by what looked like a food shop. He saw a
man walk out with a bag full of food and drinks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Perhaps I can get
this thing called wine, the drink my grandpa was talking about, from
this shop.' Fex thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he went inside,
he started to look around the shop in the drinks section for an item
labelled as wine. However, he noticed while he was walking around in
the shop that others would still continually look at him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have my

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, I can no

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After ignoring the
people giving him sideway glances, he had eventually found the drink
labelled as wine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There's so

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He grabbed a random
bottle and rushed over to the counter, waiting for his turn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would like

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;ID please.&quot;
The counter clerk asked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;ID?&quot; Fex,
was confused. Unknown to him every citizen of Earth was required to
carry around an ID. If Fex had paid attention in his classes, then he
would have known that he would obtain a fake one when he reached the
age of eighteen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How old are

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sixteen, can I
not purchase this drink then, I have the money,&quot; Fex said, with
an innocent smile on his face. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, of course,

payment as usual. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then as Fex had left
the shop, the clerk immediately opened up his screen and dialled the
number 111. &quot;Hello, I'd like to report someone on Bader street…

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Walking down the
street with his backpack in his hand, Fex was smiling broadly. His
grandpa had looked after him nearly his whole life and it was only a
few years ago that he had decided to go into an eternal sleep and
give control of the family over to Fex's father. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Fex never forgot
the stories his grandpa used to tell him, the countless things earth
had to offer them as vampires. Of course, it had been many years
since his grandpa had visited earth but the one thing he would never
stop talking about was this drink called wine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was why Fex put
it at the top of his to-do list when he would finally visit earth. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I can
tell,&quot; Fex replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did the family
find us already?&quot; Ham asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex started to sniff
the air when he noticed that there were at least four people
following them from a distance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No they don't
smell like vampires, most likely they are humans. But why are they
following us?&quot; Fex said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Fex didn't
pay much attention during his lessons, there was one law that was
hammered into his head. Never, under any circumstance, reveal
yourself to humans. If they found out what you are you only had two
options. Bring them back with you to turn them into a blooded, or
kill them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now he was
sure he hadn't done anything to make him look suspicious. Although
there was a law against revealing that you're a vampire, there was no
such law saying anything about fighting with humans. Fex decided to
turn around a corner into a dark alleyway, to confront the humans
following him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know you're
following me.&quot; Fex said. &quot;Is it because I bought this?&quot;
He lifted up the plastic bag that contained the bottle of wine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look I know
times are rough but I heard the cities were quite wealthy, if you
want I can buy another bottle for you.&quot; Fex offered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two men stepped
towards Fex. &quot;Relax, we are not looking for trouble.&quot; One
of them said. &quot;We just want to confirm your age and if you have
any ID on you?&quot; The other one said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's about my
age again, what's with this place? I already said I'm 16 and about
the ID I must have lost it somewhere.&quot; Fex exclaimed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two men then
looked at each other. When people were trying to avoid the military
draft it was quite common for them to get rid of their IDs. They
would try to live their life by other means never showing their ID
card. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Fex looked young
and he had also confirmed his age to them. No more questioning was
needed, the actions they had to take where clear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fire when

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Looks like I might
have to fight my way out of this one.' Fex thought. But he knew he
had to be careful not to use any of his vampire abilities. But that
didn't mean he had to hold back from using his regular abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He took a step
forward and a small sharp pain was felt in the side of his neck. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
���<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What
the..?&quot; as he looked to the side he noticed that something that
looked like a dart had been shot into his neck, inside the dart a
green liquid could be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why am I

he had collapsed onto the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two men walked
up to the sleeping boy. &quot;Luckily he didn't have a hardening
ability, I was ready to get into a scrap there.&quot; One of the men
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back at the castle,
a certain man was sitting in a large throne-like chair. In his left
hand, a single glass contained a red liquid inside. While his other
hand was busy restlessly tapping on the arm of his chair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man looked like
the mature version of Fex, they were almost identical with the
exception of the goatee that slightly covered his chin. While sitting
in the chair he had a deep frown on his face. This man was Fex father
Lee, Lee Sanguinis. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is there any

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Kneeling down in

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes Sir Lee,
we discovered that Fex has arrived at the city of Toklon.
Unfortunately, it seems like the humans have managed to get to him
before we could sir.&quot; One of the subordinates said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then Lee
slapped his hand across his forehead while continuing to shake his
head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That boy will
be the ruin of this family.&quot; Lee said. &quot;The silly boy never
paid any attention to his classes, yet he always listened to my
father's crazy stories. Do we know where they have taken him?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Our resources
say that he was taken to one of the military bases, to be admitted
into military school. When they found him they thought he was a draft
evader.&quot; The same subordinate replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lee was busy
thinking about what to do. If the other families got word of what had
happened then his family would become the laughing stock of the
vampire community. Even more worrisome was if their secret was
discovered then their family would also be punished. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily it seemed
like the news hadn't spread yet. The other vampire families were all
too busy discussing the new family that had appeared. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lee then looked at
the five subordinates in front of him and was deciding who it would
be best to send. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;
A female subordinate replied as she stood up. Just like her name
suggested she had bright long silver hair that was tied in a ponytail
that nearly went down to her knees. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you are the

remember that. You will have the next two days off to rest, after

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Erin had
been raised without a life of entertainment. There were no fantasy
books, games, or movies provided for her. All her time and education
only had to do with fighting or learning about the current state of
the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She wasn't the only
one in this position since a lot of them shared her ignorance. Quinn
was in a similar situation himself. He had heard the term vampires,
but didn't really know much about them, so he had to rely on Layla to
explain it to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that
confession, the others slowly started to explain what a vampire was
to her - How they were weaker in the sunlight and most of all, they
required Human blood to keep on living. All of this news was coming
as quite a shock to Erin because it sounded so fake in her mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So this is
what you guys came up with to try to give an excuse why Quinn didn't
use his powers.&quot; She said. &quot;Well, I'm not buying it. I
don't believe that a human that needs blood to survive exists. If
there were such creatures as vampires, why haven't they revealed
themselves to the world already?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin then went
towards the door, pulling it open before saying her final words. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You guys
disappoint me. I was starting to think that we were a team, not a
bunch of liars.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, she
closed the door behind her and stormed off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you think
she'll tell anyone?&quot; Quinn asked </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
kidding? With a reaction like that?&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;She
didn't even believe it herself. She'll have an easier time convincing
someone that she's a boy rather than you being a vampire. Well, how
did we expect her to react? 'Oh it's okay, you can have my blood any
time? She's not Layla, for goodness sake.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla was annoyed at
Vorden's remarks, but at the same time, she couldn't deny that she
had the same reaction when she found out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm going to
go check up on her, just to make sure she really doesn't tell anyone.
I'll give you an update about it tomorrow, Quinn.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Erin didn't
seem to believe it, Peter for some reason did. He didn't know how to
explain it, but ever since he had left, his body felt different. His
hearing was better, and he didn't feel as weak as before. There was
some sort of connection that he felt between Quinn and him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was as if the two
of them were now connected, somehow. The last thing that convinced
him was the fact that he wasn't dead. He remembered seeing the
Dalki's fist go through his own stomach. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, does it

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter asked that
question, Quinn didn't know what to reply because Peter wasn't the
same as him. While Quinn was originally a halfling, Peter was
something known as a ghoul. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm afraid it

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lately, the system
seemed to be the bearer of bad news more than bringing good. Quinn
already had a feeling that the word ghoul didn't have the best sound,
but at the moment Peter seemed fine and Quinn decided to put his
worries behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's with
the look on your face?&quot; Peter said worriedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, it's
nothing I just think maybe we should note this down on a piece of
paper or something so you remember what I tell you,&quot; Quinn
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then went over to
his desk and pulled out a piece of paper from his drawer. Vorden and
Peter were hovering over his shoulder taking a look at what he was
writing. First Quinn put his name at the top and by the side wrote
down the word: Vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then listed all
the strengths and weaknesses he had. Super strength, abnormal
healing, and the ability to see in darkness. He also listed down the
powers he had along with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then underneath with
a line branching off from the top he wrote down Peter's name and
wrote the word ghoul. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm a ghoul?&quot;
Peter said looking at the word. &quot;What does that mean?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First, do you
feel any different Peter, or has anything changed like voices in your
head or weird things in your vision.&quot; Quinn was trying to see if
Peter also had a system, but he needed to tiptoe around the word. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Other than my
body feeling better, there haven't been any other changes.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about
your ability?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;I remember when Quinn asked
me if I wanted to turn into a vampire he said I would lose my
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter then quickly
went over to his desk where he always had a small ball of earth to
practise on he held it on his hands and tried to do what he usually
did, but there was nothing. &quot;What it's not working do I really
have no ability at all!&quot; Peter said all panicky. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Calm down.&quot;
Quinn interrupted.&quot; Don't worry about it too much, although your
ability is gone you can learn a new one. We just need to find one
that's compatible like my shadow book.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You mean I can
have the same ability as yours?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
laugh nervously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Unfortunately
after learning the ability is got destroyed by a beast.&quot; Vorden
quickly interrupted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Anyway, let me
try to explain everything I know,&quot; Quinn said as he grabbed the
pencils and wrote a pros and cons list right next to Peter's name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
ready?&quot; the system asked. While the system explained the
difference between a vampire and a vampire ghoul Quinn would write it
down on a piece of paper while explaining it out loud to the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why don't we
start with the positives?&quot; the system said. &quot;First unlike a
vampire, a ghoul is not affected by sunlight.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter breathed a
sigh of relief when he heard this. &quot;I thought I might have to
start carrying an umbrella around everywhere.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system continued
and so did Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ghouls are
stronger, faster and can see better than a human. But their main
strength is their incredible healing abilities, they are even more
impressive than yours Quinn. Broken bones chunks of flesh will be
instantly healed on the spot.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That isn't too
bad.&quot; Vorden said. &quot;Peter, this means we can just say you
have a self-healing ability, there are a few of them out there.
Although we will have to keep it a secret from the school since they
all think you have an earth ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What if
someone sees, or tries hurting me and finds out?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,
not many people know of the other students' ability other than the
staff, but if push comes to shove, I can try clearing their mind with
my influence skill.&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now the next
bit of information is more for you Quinn.&quot; The system said.
&quot;Ghouls are most loyal to their maker, the main reason for this
is because your blood resides inside their body. Unfortunately what
this means is you will need to supply Peter with your own blood
otherwise his body will start to deteriorate and eventually will
cease to exist. As long as he gets a supply of your blood then he
will live on forever by your side.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean by loyal?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Similar to how
your charm skill works, whatever you command, Peter will feel like he
has no choice but to obey, although this does depend on the amount of
your blood that remains inside his body. The longer he goes without a
new does of blood the less inclined he will be to follow your
orders.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now Quinn was
feeling bad for Layla and Vorden. It seems like a bloody business was
taking place. While Quinn would get his blood form Layla or Vorden
then Peter would need to get his blood from him, which would require
Quinn to get more blood from the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about
Human blood, will I need to drink that,&quot; Peter asked as he
gulped. Feeling a strange new hunger in his stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No there is no
need to drink human blood,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;Actually,
unlike me who gets stronger from human blood, it will have no effect
on you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now it seemed
like they were getting a clearer picture of how a ghoul worked. It
had superhuman capabilities similar to a vampire but had none of the
vampire skills Quinn had at his disposal. But it did have
supernatural healing that surpassed his own as well as being able to
retain his strength in the sun. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although he wasn't
too strong now once Peter had an ability the others could see him
becoming quite powerful. The only con so far was the fact that he
needed Quinn's blood. Although Quinn decided to leave the loyalty
part out of his explanation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
already felt this strange connection without having to say anything,
and Quinn had a feeling if he asked Peter to do something, he would. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn knew the
system wouldn't have said this was one of the worst options if this
was the only issue with being a ghoul. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, time for
the cons.&quot; The system said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing these words
made Quinn's hand shake a little, and the others could see this as he
was getting ready to write down what the system was telling him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

too bad. After all Quinn himself was only in a slightly better
situation. At the moment the only food he could enjoy was meat.

it was meat, and more specifically red meat he could still enjoy the
taste of it quite well. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During this whole
time, Quinn had basically been repeating to the others what the
system had told him. Making sure to leave out the parts that weren't

for them to know about the system. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What why?&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just sit
down.&quot; Quinn said, but as he said these words his eyes started
to glow a little. Peter didn't know why but he felt like he needed to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can see this

grab him human flesh.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked Peter in

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Being a ghoul

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Raw meat, as
in uncooked food?&quot; Peter questioned. &quot;Won't I get sick from
it though? They carry so many diseases and the human body isn't
designed to process raw food.&quot; As Peter continued to speak his
words got faster as he panicked even more. &quot;Maybe you're wrong,
why don't I just try eating some normal food and see how it goes?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For goodness

you here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, Vorden
and Quinn decided to head to the nearby convenience store to grab
some things as a test while they asked Peter to stay in the room.
Once again although Peter was scared and wanted to come with them, a
certain feeling was passing from Quinn and onto Peter making him feel
like he had to obey. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I guess this is

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two of them
walked to the convenience store Quinn was keeping awfully quiet,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go on, tell me

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's about
Peter….&quot; Quinn said quietly. &quot;I didn't tell Peter
everything, being a ghoul doesn't mean he has to eat raw meat, he
needs to eat raw human meat. Raw animal meat will only work for a
short time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly Vorden
stopped in his tracks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn I'm
being serious when I suggest this here, but wouldn't it be better to
just kill Peter… and before you say anything hear me out. He
already tried taking our lives and we know the reason behind it now.
But I'm afraid this will just cause you more problems in the future.
He saved your life and you saved his, and if I kept a scoreboard, he
still needs to save you one more time to make it even. He's not the
type of guy who can handle this and if he gets caught then don't
think he won't give you in.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He won't, he
can't&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How can you be
so sure?&quot; Vorden asked, a bit surprised by Quinn's sudden
answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was hard for
Quinn to explain, but he could feel the connection between the two of
them now. Essentially Peter's whole existence now depended on him and
as long as Quinn asked for it Peter would do it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well I can
tell you won't take my suggestion but let me tell you this then.&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;Taking a life isn't as easy as you think.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn knew
the weight behind Vorden's words, what Vorden didn't know was Quinn
had already done just that and it was easier than he had expected.
Perhaps for a human, it wasn't so easy but the same couldn't be said
for a vampire like Quinn now, especially those people that deserved
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two continued to
go to the shop and bought all sorts of packs of meat, Vorden was
ready to use his wrist watch but Quinn just straight up paid for it
instead. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the two had

was in the same spot as when the two had left him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That smells

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then pulled
out the packs of food. Some were raw pieces of steak and pork while
the others were pre packed food that had already been cooked, Peter
didn't need to see anything because his nose was already telling him

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was one of the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They placed the raw

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't tell

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It didn't take long
for Peter to dive in. Seeing the raw steak in front of him, suddenly
caused his hunger to grow more and more to the point he couldn't hold
back, and without even using the knife and fork by his side he picked
up the steak with his two hands and started biting into it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter.&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;You're less of a monster now then you were before,
at least you know what you are and what you did before was wrong. How
do you think Quinn feels after saving your life and you saying that
right in front of him?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the experiment
done and the other two feeling a bit better they placed the remainder

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day had
arrived and when Vorden had woken up, he had faint bags under his
eyes. Quinn eventually managed to get some sleep, but he didn't seem
to have fared much better either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Didn't get

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden shook his
head while looking at Peter who seemed to still be sleeping
peacefully away. &quot;At least he still looks like a human.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of the
first-year students had gotten the next two days off after the
expedition. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the next two
days off Quinn knew he needed to hurry and find a solution for
Peter's situation. It was a large city that not only had the people
from the school but the workers and soldiers outside as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was bound to
be a morgue in the city. Although crimes that lead to death did not
occur, like in a regular city since most of the citizens were
soldiers, but that didn't mean there weren't any. One thing was for
sure, they didn't want to get a body from the morgue in the school
they were in. It would be too obvious and another investigation would
be carried out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was
thinking about what to do a knock was heard at the door. When they
opened the door they were surprised to see Layla there. She was on
her own though but came to update them on the situation with Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems like
she has calmed down a bit,&quot; Layla said. &quot;And I'll be honest
it was strange. She really wasn't upset by the fact you were a
vampire even after I tried explaining it to her, but just that you
could have helped us out more during the assessment. Anyway, what
about him?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went on
to explain about what had happened to Peter and how he had turned
into a ghoul. When Quinn mentioned this, her face immediately
dropped, she had read enough books to know some of the downsides of
being in close proximity to a ghoul. Some of them were blood hungry
starved creatures, while others constantly craved human flesh. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And after hearing
Quinn's explanation it seemed like she was right. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know after
seeing you turn Peter, I thought you were hiding something from me,
but I guess this was something you were afraid of and honestly being
a vampire is cool and all, but being a ghoul not so much,&quot; Layla
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
think about what Layla had just said, before everything had happened,
he was seriously considering turning Layla into a vampire. However,
the system had stated that this outcome, someone turning into a
ghoul, was one of the options. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System, if I
was to use the blood ritual on Layla would it be the same result?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Honestly, I'm
not sure, it depends on the person and the situation they were in.
Perhaps Peter had turned because of how close to death he was when
the ritual was formed but maybe he would have turned into one anyway
considering how weak his mind was. I can't say that it won't happen,
but I believe that Layla would have a higher chance of turning into
something else.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, Quinn
decided to keep the words of the System to himself. He already had
enough problems to deal with, and he didn't need another one if Layla
was to turn into something else even more problematic than a ghoul. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh. I almost
forgot.&quot; Vorden said, as he went under his bed and pulled out a
small bag before throwing it over to Quinn who caught it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn opened the bag
and noticed that it seemed to be full of crystals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Since, the
expedition ended early, we got to keep all of those.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You mean these
are?&quot; Quinn asked, with a look of excitement on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yep. The
winged Lizard crystals you asked for. &quot; Vorden replied, with a
smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking in the bag
there looked to be around thirty of them, Quinn couldn't imagine what
the group must have done to be able to obtain this many. But now he
realised why Erin was incredibly upset, with this amount of crystals,
their group would have come out on top of the whole leader board. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, though he
had enough crystals to create a costume for himself. The cape that
Sam used was hard enough to block Quinn's blood swipes while also
being flexible. If he could use this to create a full set of clothing
then he would finally be able to fight during the day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although at first,
he wasn't sure who he could go to for help to design a costume,
suddenly someone came to mind. Logan, if there was anyone who was
good at creating things and knowing if something was possible or not,
he would be the one to go to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, he couldn't
just leave Peter as he was, not with the chance of him turning into a
flesh hungry monster. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden could see
that Quinn seemed to be struggling with something. There must have
been a reason why he had told him and Layla to gather as many of
those crystals as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just go do
whatever you need to do,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;Layla and I can
deal with the problem; I have an idea anyway.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you sure,
what about the others do you want me to pay you guys for these?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
joking,&quot; Layla said. &quot;Quinn if it wasn't for you back then
when the Dalki attacked, we would have all lost our lives and that
includes Erin. As much as she says she's angry at you she can't deny
that you saved our lives. The least we could do is give you these
crystals for free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at them
one more time, and knew that if there was anyone he could rely on, it
would be Vorden, and even more so with Layla helping him. &quot;Alright,
just let me know if there are any problems, I should be in the VIP
area just above.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After that Quinn
quickly rushed out of the room with the crystals in his hand. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;In the VIP

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who knows?&quot;
Vorden said as he shrugged his shoulders. Just then Peter was
starting to wake up and rub his eyes. &quot;But right now, we have a
bigger problem to deal with.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was their day off
and early in the morning, Quinn was going out to meet up with Logan.
He had left both Layla and Vorden behind to keep an eye on Peter.
Quinn had told them that at some point, Peter would be required to
eat human flesh, it could take up to a week, but it could also be
tomorrow, there was no way to know for sure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'It could also be as
soon as today.' Vorden thought to himself. 'We can't be that unlucky
right?' He certainly hoped this was not the case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately, the
tasks that Quinn had given to them were quite difficult. Not only did
they need to look out for Peter's safety, but they also had to find a
way to get human flesh without letting him find out about it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on
Peter,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;Let's head outside.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Outside?&quot;
Peter asked, his tone slightly confused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, if I
were you, the first thing I'd want to do was to test out my new
powers. Quinn said that you are some kind of superhuman, right? Well,
why don't we take a look at what you can do now?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think that's
a great idea,&quot; Layla said while bobbing up and down. Although
she didn't like the sound of being turned into a ghoul, perhaps it
also had its good sides. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
grabbed a few things and got ready to go outside. Layla even took her
beast equipment with her. A lot of the students carried around their
beast weapons as they walked through the city, but some chose not to.
Mainly because currently, they were in one of the safest places on
the planet. However, since the Dalki had attacked some students
during the extra-planar expedition, everyone seemed to be more on
edge and always ready for battle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as they were
about to leave, Peter stopped by the entrance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,&quot;
Layla said. &quot;Even Quinn doesn't burn under the sunlight. He just
feels weak and sluggish. Besides, just in case Quinn was wrong, I
brought an umbrella with me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What are you doing'
Peter thought to himself. 'You spent your whole life as a weakling
and now, just maybe, it can start to change.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After convincing
himself, Peter closed his eyes and stepped outside to where the sun
could touch his skin. Just as Quinn had said, he didn't feel any
weaker than before. He felt the same on the inside as he did outside.
With this information, a smile appeared on Peter's face. At the
least, he could live a somewhat normal life without having to hide in
the shadows all the time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group walked
towards the park, and once they arrived, they headed deeper into the
park woods. They followed the man-made trail that was often used for
people to hike through, until eventually leaving the trail, as they
travelled farther away from the beaten path. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued to
walk until they had finally found a quiet and clear area in the woods
that was devoid of trees; it was also hidden from view. &quot;This
place is perfect. Besides, if anyone comes close, we will be able to
hear them in time.&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What should we
test first?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How about
strength and speed?&quot; Vorden said as he walked up to Layla,
holding out his hand. &quot;Do you mind?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla looked at
Vorden. These days, he seemed to be more reliable than before. She
still felt that he was a bit crazy in the head, but couldn't call him
an outright bad person, not without any evidence anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine.&quot;
She held out her hand and allowed Vorden to copy her abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
lifted a bunch of branches and stick's off of the ground. Because
Layla's ability was quite weak, the maximum they could lift was two
each, making it four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just do your
best to avoid the sticks as much as you can!&quot; Vorden shouted as
the two stood around five meters away from Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like,
not only has his speed gotten better, but his reflexes as well,&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;But… He's still Peter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter nodded when he
was ready, and the two of them immediately started to hover the
sticks up in the air, aiming to hit Peter with them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sticks were
light, allowing Vorden and Layla to move them quite fast. They were
easily as fast as regular attacks, and with four of them coming from
different directions, it was like two people were fighting against
Peter at the same time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For Peter it was the
first time that he felt confident during a practice, it was like he
could see the attacks coming towards him. When he told his body to
move, it followed what he wanted to do, avoiding the branches of
sticks. It was amazing since whatever Peter thought in his head, his
body reacted and did it, unlike when his body didn't respond to his
thoughts against other people before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, Vorden
timed both sticks at the right time - When one went in for the
attack, if Peter was to avoid it, the other one would be right in
time to strike him. Peter pulled his body back, avoiding the first
stick. Then, the second one from behind came right at his face, but
he still managed to catch the second stick out of the air at the last
second just as he pulled his face back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the tip of
the stick still managed to cut his cheek, drawing the smallest amount
of blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh sorry,
Peter!&quot; Vorden yelled as the two of them rushed over. But by the
time they reached him, the blood had fallen on the ground, and the
cut that was once on Peter's cheek was no longer there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like the
super healing can be checked as well,&quot; Vorden said with a smile
on his face. He was actually glad that this had happened, because he
was afraid that if they were to test out the super healing any other
way, then it would cause Peter to grow hungrier even quicker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next test they
had for Peter was his strength. For this trial, they used a simple
tree. Although Vorden was considered one of the students at the peak
physical fitness for his height and age, even he wouldn't be able to
damage a tree with his bare hands. That was unless he was wearing
beast gear or had some type of ability to help him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So you want me
to just punch the tree?&quot; Peter asked, looking at it carefully.
The tree was mighty, and its trunk was thicker than Peter himself.
Just imagining punching the thing, he could already feel the pain in
his knuckles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just go for
it,&quot; Layla said. &quot;You already know that you have super
healing. &quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But that
doesn't mean that I don't feel any pain,&quot; Peter said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he was also
curious to see how much stronger he had gotten. He readied himself
and looked at the tree, then pulling back his fist, he swung it
outward. However, at the last second, he tried pulling back his power
for fear of hurting himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he hit the tree,
he had done so at an odd angle causing his wrist to bend on impact.
He screamed out in pain. As the two went to take a look, they could
see that a part of his bone had come out and pierced through his
skin, but at the same time, it was healing then and there in an
instant. When they looked at the tree, there was a large dent that
had been made. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not one large enough
to cause the tree to fall over, but one that would be impossible for
most humans by using their bare hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once Peter's wrist
was healed, he started to twist it around and move it about - It
seemed to be working just like normal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, we know
you have abnormal strength that's for sure, but I think there's a
clear difference between you and Quinn,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Peter asked, still rolling his wrist around, making sure
everything worked okay. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, let's
say if Quinn was to do the same thing, even if he didn't punch the
tree dead on, his wrist probably would have been fine. I think that's
because his body is stronger than that of a regular human.&quot;
Layla explained. &quot;While yours, although you have super strength,
your body is still just like ours, made of regular bones and flesh.
If you attack at full power, you will probably end up hurting
yourself, breaking a bone just like what you did back then. Heck even
humans break their bones when they fight, so for you with your extra
strength it's a little worse. You're going to have to learn to
control it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Layla had
finished explaining, the wristwatch on Peter's arm started to light
up. When he looked at it, he could see a voice message that had been
left. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is
General Duke. Peter Chuck, you are required to come to my office in

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Vorden
heard the message, there was no longer any need for him to ask Peter
who was behind everything. He had already figured it out. Why else
would the head of the second years have anything to do with a
first-year? </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was also a
rumour that had been going around that the students who were sent
into the dungeon came back without any abilities at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because of this,
even Vorden was worried about going up against a general of the
school. Perhaps he could use his family's power to influence the
military's decision about Duke, but that would require evidence and a
lot more than a single testimony from Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So the group had no

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What should I

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We'll follow
along as far as we can go, but if they see you with us then they'll
think you're no longer on their side. Just agree to whatever they ask
of you for now and we can figure it out later,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, as they
were about to exit the forest, Vorden suggested that Peter walk up
ahead while they followed him from behind. They needed to be extra
careful just in case, but before Peter left the forest Vorden had a
few words to say. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, I'm
taking my chances with you this time. I don't know why but Quinn
seems to completely trust you, and while I have forgiven you, it
doesn't mean I trust you. Not yet, or maybe ever.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla nudged Vorden
in the ribs. &quot;Give the guy a break will you?&quot; She
whispered, &quot;He went through a near death experience, and now
he's just been told that he's a ghoul. You don't have to say out loud
what he already knows.&quot; She gave Peter an encouraging smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Vorden was
dead serious; he still saw Peter as a liability and if it wasn't for
Quinn, he would have gotten rid of him by now. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had finally
arrived at the second year building which was stationed on the east
side of the school. From this point on, Vorden and Layla could no
longer follow as there were second year students standing just
outside, and they didn't have a good reason. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, Peter managed
to walk straight past the two second year students, as they had been
expecting him, but Vorden and Layla knew they couldn't because they
would be stopped. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems the
two of us haven't been able to talk since the last task I had set for
you.&quot; Duke then went under his desk and pulled out several books
and placed them on the table. There were three earth ability books
numbered from two, up to four. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Just why was he
trying so hard to get rid of Vorden in the first place?' Peter

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter left the
room, he spotted Earl waiting just outside to be called in. &quot;What
are you looking at you dog!&quot; He snapped back. Earl still hadn't
recovered from what Vorden had done to him before the outing, and
because he was weaker than Vorden, he couldn't take it out on him. So
he decided to take it out on Peter instead. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the others
were busy doing their own thing, Erin had eventually calmed down from

what was a vampire actually? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Layla
had tried her best to explain it, it really wasn't something she
could comprehend. It didn't sound like an ability, but more like an
entirely different species altogether. But the strangest thing of it
all was what species could survive only on the blood of humans? </FONT></FONT>

actually was. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, that led
her to the library. At first, Erin went down the nonfiction aisle to
see if there was anything she could find, but there was nothing.
There were no vampires and there didn't seem to be anything close to
describing them in the first place. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
needed to be careful that they weren't seen while they were sneaking
around, so the two of them would be using Layla's abilities to make
sure of that. When they got around to the back side of the building,
they could see another student standing guard there. Using Layla's
powers, they both lifted up a couple of stones, and threw them to
distract the student. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was patiently
waiting outside the place where he had suggested. While waiting,
Peter started to look around the place. Since there were no exits,
there weren't many students moving about back here. There was also a
plain wall, but it was nearly impossible for someone to scale unless
they had some type of ability. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey! Hey,
Peter! It's been a while, hasn't it?&quot; Earl said, as he walked
closer before adding: &quot;You know, lately, Duke has been blaming
me for all of the failed attempts against Vorden, so I haven't been
getting any rewards, how are you going to solve that for me?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

towards Peter, Earl looked at what was in Peter's hands, which were
the level 2, 3 and 4 earth ability books. Although Earl was already a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The truth was, Earl
didn't really care about the books. And if he asked for them, then
Peter was likely to give them to him. All he wanted to do was vent
out his pent-up frustrations on someone, and Peter was the perfect

to check it out now that they were here anyway. They had already come
this far, and the least they could do is try everything before giving
up. As they made their way to the space between the two buildings,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's plan was to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This would be very

researchers who worked privately for different corporations.
Sometimes even governments, different armies and all sorts of
companies. Anyway, on one of their trips around fifty years ago, they
discovered this device. At the time no one knew what it was and it
seemed like our ability didn't work on it either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, my family
tried to research it and eventually when we discovered the Dalki
technology we found similarities between this and the Dalki
technology. It appears to be some type of teleporter. But the
question is, why Dalki technology would exist on earth before they
even arrived. Then that just brings us even more questions, why did
the Dalki attack us? Were they here before? But did we just never
know about it?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing all of these
questions were causing Quinn to think about it. Perhaps Logan was on
to something before he would have taken everything the government had
told him as fact. He knew they hid things, governments always did,
but just like his vampire system were they hiding even bigger secrets
from the public? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Anyway.&quot;
Logan said.&quot; It's not like I'm expecting you to know any of
these answers. The one thing we do know is whoever was able to create
a compact teleporter such as this is a genius. Oh, how I wish I could
meet him one day.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, what did
you say?&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;Did you say you don't know who
created it?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course I
don't. If I did, my family and I would have been chasing him for
generations.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This made Quinn sink
even deeper in thought. Richard Eno was a well-known scientist, the
person who had discovered not only the power of beast crystals but
also how the Dalki portals worked. Could he have really known
everything all along? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now though
this was too big of a problem to solve especially for someone like
him. He was just one person in this whole thing and he had his own
problems to deal with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Anyway,&quot;
Logan said. &quot;What did you visit me here for, did you want to
play the game again?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually,&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had explained
the specifics of the suit he wanted to Logan. He elaborated on how it
needed to be made using the crystals he had obtained, and how he
needed it to completely cover him from head to toe, making sure that
no sunlight could touch him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Logan had
some good news for Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, it seems
you've come to the right person,&quot; said Logan. &quot;I can design
you one myself.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Really?&quot;
Quinn asked, surprised. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course, it
will be easier than making some of my other contraptions, since most
of them are powered by beast crystals anyway. I know my way around
them. The fusion process I am using is also one of a kind.&quot; He
said smiling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan was clearly
proud of his work, and Quinn could see this. Whenever he used to come
by for his training, he would often praise his inventions, even if
some of them seemed pointless or a bit out there. Because of this,
Logan started to have more than just professional interest in Quinn,
but also started to like him more as a friend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, like with
everything, there was also a slight problem. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about
breathing and seeing?&quot; Logan asked. &quot;If you're going to be
covered from head to toe, you won't be able to breathe. Judging from
the cape you described, the material won't be breathable, and if you
cover the eyes you won't be able to see anything either. I can place
a sensory display in front of your eyes. It will work like the VR
game and allow you to see outside, but that doesn't solve the problem
that you won't be able to breathe&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then started
to look around the room while trying to come up with an idea. It
looked like creating this suit wasn't going to be as easy as he
thought. He proceeded to spot a small figurine, with a type of gas
mask on it, in the corner of the room. It reminded him of the mask he
first used when he went out hunting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Could we
create something like this? Maybe if we put some tubes, sticking out
from the side or something, I can still breathe.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, that
could work, but you definitely won't get any points in the fashion
department,&quot; Logan replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh and one
more thing. If we could make the mask open and close that would be
great, you know, just in case I wanted to grab myself a quick snack
while on the move,&quot; Quinn said smiling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
sat down together. The crystals were placed in a seemingly special
container while they were going through some type of melting process.
Out of the 39 crystals obtained, Logan had said they would only need
thirty, leaving the rest for Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had offered to
pay for the process, or even give the remaining crystals to Logan,
but he kept refusing. Stating that he could earn in a minute the
amount of money used to create such a thing, so there was no loss on
his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On top of Logan's
desk, a large metal sheet was placed. Logan then placed his hand on
the sheet and closed his eyes. Just like with the Gauntlet before,
the metal started to break down and move. Eventually turning into
little metal bugs again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The metal bugs
started to form a human figure until it moulded something that
vaguely resembled Quinn. The two of them continued to go through the
design process, altering what the metal model looked like. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each time Quinn
would give a suggestion, the robots would move in place. There was
not much that could be done with the suit. It had to be black in
colour and fit skin tight. However, the mask could be altered
greatly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When using the
outfit and mask, Quinn wanted to strike fear into his opponent's
hearts - He wanted something quite scary looking. They went through
several designs until it was finally done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon after, Logan
went straight to work. The beast crystals that were in the container
had been liquefied, and now Logan had once again put on his tool
glove. He went over to his workbench and started working straight
away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Listening to every
detail and simultaneously thinking so much was starting to make Quinn
tired. He eventually drifted off at the desk, until finally he fell
asleep. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a while, Logan
nudged the young man to wake up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, wake up
sleepyhead,&quot; Logan said. &quot;It's done.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn opened up
his eyes, he was greeted with a metallic life-size model of him. It
was in the same height and the same body proportions to him.
Although, it had none of his facial features. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the big
difference between the creation and him was the fact that it was
wearing both the outfit and the mask they had designed together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's amazing,&quot;
Quinn said as he walked over to it and started to stroke the model. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The black suit was
skin tight but had a scaled pattern like that of a snake throughout
its entire surface. However, there were a few design touches added to
it from Logan that Quinn hadn't asked for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you like
the additions that I made?&quot; Logan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the forearms
going up to the shoulder, three red claw like marks could be seen on
both sides. Although it looked nice, Quinn was hoping for the suit to
be all black in colour. If he was to also use this at night, he
probably would've been seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nevertheless, when
he looked at Logan's bags and his tired face, he found it hard to say
no. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's great,&quot;
Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, what looked
the best out of all to Quinn was the mask - It was made out of a
metallic material that went over the black suit. It covered the mouth
all the way to the top of the nose. On the outside, by the cheeks,
two squares could be seen that stuck out slightly. Over the mouth, a
pattern of teeth could be seen protruding. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The teeth were
moulded outwards to look more realistic, like that of a beast. It
wasn't painted on the outside and when opened, it would look like a
large beast was about to hold you in its jaws. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, I do have
to warn you. Although expensive metals were used when making this,
there is a limit to how much it can endure.&quot; Logan explained.
&quot;They were only basic tier crystals after all. It will fare well
against intermediate weapons, but anything stronger than that and it
will be cut.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn made sure to
make note of that, for it would be the same when facing against
beasts. If he was fighting during the day he would be sure to pick
and choose his opponents. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although suddenly,
Quinn's body started to feel a strange sensation. It was a similar
feeling to when he consumed blood, only a tad different. His eyes
started to glow once again, a strange power was surging through his
body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What the hell is
happening?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, are you
okay?&quot; Logan said. &quot;Do you need me to go get a doctor or
something?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Logan stood in
front of Quinn, he could see the colour in his eyes change, and even
Logan stepped back a bit. At the same time, little metallic bugs
started to come over and built a metallic suit of his own over his
body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, the bugs
had completely formed a metallic suit that looked like that of a
small mech suite, only without all the clunky parts and more in line
with the shape of a human. These were all precautions that Logan
took, just in case Quinn was to go out of control. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then, the
feeling died down and his eyes returned to normal, but a message had
appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[A family member has

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
