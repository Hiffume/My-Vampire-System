<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
starting to leave the room one by one. It was their day off and they
didn't want to hang around in the assemble hall any longer than they
needed to. Most of them were leaving with smiles on their faces,
excited for the upcoming event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Jack mentioning
and informing the students of his plans to be at the Inter military
base event. They were now eager to impress him, and wanted to start
practising right away. If Jack was to offer them an invitation to
join his family it would be a shortcut to the top. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, unless one
was extremely talented they would have to build a reputation for
themselves from their own factions and work their way up. Nearly
everyone, who wished to become a traveller had a goal of joining the
big four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if you created
your own faction, it was beneficial to work under one of the big
four, mainly for protection from the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, not all the
students had smiling faces as they left the hall, there were some who
didn't feel the same way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, would you
move,&quot; A student said as he accidentally bumped into Quinn on
his way out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was wrong
with that guy?&quot; Another student said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not moving from his
spot, Quinn hadn't moved but he wasn't the only one who had remained
motionless. After hearing the final name that had been called out,
the whole group was shocked at what they had heard. For the final
name was Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Logan waited
outside he realised the others hadn't come out with him, so he took a
bite of his sandwich, before he said, &quot;Guys, come on, we need to
start our plan straight away. I know this is a shock, but that
doesn't stop us from the original plan, instead of saving one, now we
just need to save two.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Logan's words,
the group quickly snapped out of it, and started to make their way
out of the assembly hall with everyone else. Worrying about it or
thinking why Erin was chosen wasn't going to do them any good. The
more time wasted, the less likely the plan would work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students who had
been called all had gone to the front of the stage, wondering what
was going on. Peter was also upfront, but his expression hadn't
changed much. He was informed of what was going to happen, and wasn't
worried about it, he trusted his master, Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He would just do
everything his master had told him to do, and everything would work
out fine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin, on the other
hand, was panicking, her whole head was slightly swirling. 'They
picked, me but why? Aren't I one of the top students? They would
never pick a student as good as me right?' She thought to herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the realisation
had hit her, and her mask was starting to crumble away. The thoughts
and memories she had kept within were starting to surface. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few days ago,
inside the second years head office, Duke had been given a bunch of
files that matched the criteria they were looking for. That's when
they stumbled upon Erin's file. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now this is
interesting.&quot; He said. Erin was a level five student, and she
had quite an expensive ability too. She wasn't an original but the
ice element ability was expensive to get a hold of, especially at
level five, so Duke wondered why she had been selected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After reading the
file everything started to make sense. Her family worked under one of
the big four, and they had established a shelter on one of the orange
portal planets. Because of the risk involved, the family had paid
them well, and they had gained quite the status. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few years had gone
by, and it looked like the exploration of the planet was nearly over.
It was the main task that had been given to her family. They had done
a good job getting rid of the few advanced tier beast that lived in
the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin was eventually
sent back to earth to finish her normal school education. She went to
a good private school as her parents could afford it, and even bought
her a strong ability, it was an opportunity which they never had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The exploration of
the planet had been completed, and Erin had gone back over the
summer, to celebrate with her parents. At last, they had moved up
high enough in the family's ranks to obtain a place back on earth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But on that fated
day a Dalki ship had invaded the planet, the Dalki came and attacked.
Seeing her family and friends raise up their weapons to fight, she
wanted to help too. But before she could even join in the fight her
father had stopped her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No Erin, you
are not strong enough yet, you can't help us and will just get in the
way, now get out of here!&quot; He screamed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And at that moment,
she witnessed her father being stabbed through the chest. As she
stood there frozen, an old friend of her fathers managed to grab her
and run away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her family did their
best to protect all the civilians on the planet, and even the other
factions that they once squabbled over territory with had come to
help, but it wasn't enough, and all they could do was wait for help
to arrive. At this point, nearly everybody that could fight had died.
All of this havoc had been created by only two Dalki. However, the
defenders had managed to kill one of them, but the other still
remained alive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The remaining Dalki
had set its eyes on the emergency shelter, but just as it was about
to attack, help had arrived. A female dressed in pure sparkling white
came through the portal, and Erin saw her pass by. She fought against
the Dalki on her own and was able to go toe to toe with it. The
swordsmanship that had been displayed was light and silent. It was as
if her feet never even touched the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She would
continuously parry the Dalki's attacks while dishing out attacks of
her own in between, until eventually, she defeated it, and the Dalki
had died. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin cried a lot
that day, her tears wouldn't stop coming, she cried for all the
people that had been lost. The women who had defeated the Dalki
walked up to Erin, but unlike what the others thought should be said
to a child, she didn't give any words of comfort to Erin, but only
gave her the harsh truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you never
want to see your family or friends die again, then you have to become
stronger. You have to be the best, so nobody can take anything away
from you. Because your tears won't bring your family and friends
back.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And that was the
last time Erin had seen her family or the strange female warrior. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She had been
selected because she no longer had the backing her family once had.
With everyone gone she had been sent a token gesture of money from
one of the big four, just enough for her to live off of for the rest
of her life, but the political protection their family had was now
gone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But what was the
use? Money couldn't bring back the dead. The only thing that remained
in her mind from that day, were the words spoken to her by that
strange woman. She would become the best! </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin had chosen to
live by those words that day and whenever she felt tired or wanted to
give up, that same memory would come back to her. She needed proof
that what she was doing was working. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She thought she had
gotten better but the day they had met the Dalki once again, she had
frozen in place, and the only thing she could do was run. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now though,
she was being led together with the others to a certain room,
everything she had worked for up to this point, was all going to be
taken away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following closely
behind the row of students, was the mechanical spider Logan had sent
after them. Right now Logan had returned to his room and he was
monitoring the direction of the spider. He could see where they were
heading and would be able to inform the others of what needed to be
done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was also looking
at a 3D map of the whole school. On it, there were several different
indicators, each one being a different person from their group. The
spider and Peter were different colours for clarity's sake. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, Fex. It
looks like they're heading for one of the meeting rooms located on
the second floor on the west side. Layla, you stay close behind him.
Once you turn and reach the end of the corridor stay, and wait in

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack had entered the

asleep</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The eight students
were all lined up in one row, they were standing in the middle of the
meeting room. They stood ram rod straight, and all of them were
nervous, they constantly kept thinking about why they had been chosen
to meet with Jack Truedream. The only exception to this was Erin, who
was doing everything she could to keep her cool. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she looked next
to her, on her left, she could see Peter standing calmly beside her,
it was like he didn't have a care in the world. Of course, he didn't
have to worry about anything, since his powers couldn't be taken
away. However, it was different for her, her power was the only thing
she had left, if it was taken away, she wouldn't be able to keep the
promise to herself to be the best, and get stronger. Constantly
moving her head around the room, she was trying to see if there was
any way for her to get out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although none of
them were planning to sit down, there was a chair behind each of the
eight students. Perhaps, they would be asked to sit if they stayed
longer inside the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a small
meeting room that was used for one-on-one consultations. Currently,
the students were told to stand in the centre, while Jack was
standing just in front of the desk with a single chair. Lingering by
his side was the small guard dressed in green beast armour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this moment, the
main problem for them to escape was the large sentry standing guard
outside. Erin knew that the others were planning to try and get Peter
out of this situation. They were going to do that for the sole reason
that they had to, at least if they wanted to keep the matter with
Quinn a secret. But now she wished she had stayed in the meeting
room, so she would know what their plans were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Maybe she could have
even helped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, you might
be wondering why you have all been brought here in front of me,
today,&quot; Jack said. &quot;It seems like, one way or another, you
have all been suspected of a dangerous crime. Though I have no
knowledge what that crime is. Perchance, a part of a secret terrorist
group or maybe plotting to go against the military. However, it is
not my job to find out the reason, because that's the school's
responsibility.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Halting his speech,
Jack slammed his hand on the table to inculcate the gravity of the
situation to the students. He resumed his talk once he was done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The punishment
that you have been sentenced to, is to have your abilities taken
away.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Jack said
those words, a couple of students dropped to their knees,
complaining, &quot;But, I didn't do anything, this can't be right?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of them cried,
while one student, who was closest to the exit, made a dash for it.
Before he had even taken a few steps, he felt a stinging pain on the
back of his neck. At that point, his head started to swirl, and his
vision slowly began to fade, until he suddenly collapsed on the
floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh my gosh! Is
he dead?!&quot; A student cried. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others were
unable to see it, because of how fast everything had happened, but
Erin had seen it all. The guard in the green gear had taken out what
looked like a small needle and swirled it inside his mouth with his
tongue. Now, laced with a tiny amount of what looked like green
liquid, it was catapulted right at the student's nape. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I hope nobody
else tries that again,&quot; Jack said. &quot;This process is meant
to be quick and painless. Now, please sit down on the seats behind
you. I don't want there to be any more accidents.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of the remaining
students did as they were told. They carefully watched the guard lift
the student who was passed-out onto one of the empty chairs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the
deal-breaker for Erin. She had to do something otherwise she would
lose her ability forever. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hence, with a
resolute countenance, she faced Jack and uttered, &quot;But, we
really didn't do anything sir,&quot; Erin said. &quot;If you do this,
people will find out about your made-up lies, we can just tell
everyone the truth!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, don't you
worry about that, for once I take your abilities away, you shall all
pay a special visit to the dungeon. The school will then report to
your families and the other students, what was it that you said?
Right, made up lies. The most common one that is easily accepted, is
that you were all working for Pure. With that your families can't
complain, and the student's curiosity will disappear, and with it
also your existences.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The green armoured
guard from earlier then started to walk over to the students. Erin
was second to last along the row while Peter was sitting at the very
end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The guard had
prepared some type of green liquid that was placed in a glass vial.
He proceeded to place the liquid on the tip of his index finger.
Using said index finger, he would place it down right between the
eyebrows, just above the brow of the nose, of each student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, after a few
seconds, the student would fall asleep. &quot;It's a sleeping
ability?&quot; Erin mumbled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ding ding
ding, we have a winner! I'm not a monster you know. Although, by the
time that you guys wake up, you will already be in the dungeon, which
won't exactly be pleasant.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The guard was done
with the other students and it was finally Erin's turn. For a while
now, she had been fumbling with something behind her back, waiting
for Jack to get close, but he never did. He always stayed at a safe
distance, away from the students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the guard went
to place his finger on her head, she immediately swung out her arm,
aiming for his temple. In her hand she held a small dagger that had
been formed from ice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She knew the guard
was strong and fast, but a blow with a sharp object would be able to
take down most people no matter who they were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To her dismay, the
guard didn't react at all. He continued with his task, placing his
finger on her forehead. Nevertheless, just before the dagger reached
his head, with his other hand, he had grabbed it and crushed it to
pieces. The speed was too fast, so she had never thought that it was
possible to block an attack that close, unless one had a speed
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, she was sure
that he was the one who had produced the sleeping agent. It was most
likely from his saliva. Which was why he had put the needle against
his tongue. It was impossible for someone to have two abilities
unless they were like Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This just meant one
thing. The beast gear he was wearing was at such a high level, it was
able to boost the user's stats to the point where they no longer
seemed human. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, she
wasn't able to resist anymore, and a few seconds later, she was
asleep like all the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, it was
Peter's turn. Willingly, before the man had even placed his finger on
his forehead, he had closed his eyes. He knew that just looking at
these people would annoy him, but he needed to follow his master's
orders. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, he
decided to keep his eyes shut for now, and pretended to be asleep.
Once the green liquid was placed on his head, all the students were
ready. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack then looked at
the skinny guard and cleared his throat out loud, signalling for him
to leave. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you wish,
sir.&quot; He said, as he bowed down and left the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, standing
outside the door, the guards were standing at attention, like they
were two guard dogs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did he make
you leave again.&quot; The large guard asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I don't
know why. It's not like we don't know how his ability works.&quot;
The green man replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, the
mechanical spider had remained inside the room, and Peter's watch was
recorded the whole thing. Logan wasn't sure whether the second guard
would ever leave the room. Yet, for some unknown reason, it seemed
like Jack had asked him to leave. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This would make
their job a little easier, but they had to act now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Everyone, go.
Both guards are outside and only Mr. Truedream and the students are

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group outside
had received the message from Logan to proceed. The first ones to
make a move would be Fex and Layla and they had been waiting on
standby. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right behind them,
were two first-year students who had been brought along by them.
These were the students who shared a dorm room with Fex, they were
his roommates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it was anyone
else being put in this situation, Fex probably would have felt guilty
about what he was going to make them do. But they were the ones who
had attacked him when they first met, and for no reason. So he
couldn't think of any two students better suited for this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at
their eyes, a slight tint of red could be seen. They started to glow
slightly stronger as Fex faced them, and gave them a command. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few seconds later,
and they were on the move. The two students turned the corner, and
started to bump into each other on the way. While this was happening,
Fex would peak around the corner, and was twiddling his fingers, like
he was directing a puppet show. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, the
bumping escalated into shoves, as they continued their stride. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, what are
you two doing? Get out of here!&quot; The larger of the two guards
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But his words were
useless, and the two now started to shove each other harder than
before. Although it looked a bit strange, as there was no speech
involved while they were performing these actions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was because of
the limit to Fex's mind control. The more complex the instructions
were, the more likely it was for the spell to break and fail. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shoving had
turned into a full blown fist fight. While mock fighting, they were
inching their way closer to the two guards. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you guys
don't scram out of here, my foot is going to be shoved right up your
backsides!&quot; The guard shouted this time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued to
completely ignore the guard's words, but actually it was because they
couldn't hear him. Their minds were consumed with the last commend
given by Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Arms and legs were
swinging out as the two continued to fight. Right now Fex was
twiddling his fingers away faster than before, concentrating while
the sweat ran down his forehead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Controlling one
person's set of movements with the strings was easy, but coordinating
two and making it look realistic was tough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had attached
strings to both of the students and given them the command to remain
motionless, so everything they were doing right now was down to him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While everything was
happening, Layla was to stand guard, making sure no one came down the
hallway and saw them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now the two were
fighting incredibly close to the guards, and Fex had to just pull one
of his strings ever so slightly, causing an elbow to hit the large
guard in the middle of his stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Huh? Did it
not hit? But I'm sure it did?&quot; Fex was slightly confused. &quot;He
tugged on the string again, a little bit harder this time, elbowing
the guard in the stomach again. Still, there was no visible reaction.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the elbow
had hit the large guard, there was no reaction from him, whatsoever.
This was actually because of the heavy armour the man was wearing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, even though
the attack didn't hurt, the rage on his face showed his anger. &quot;You
two! I warned you, I'm going to give you a kicking you will long
remember!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's time for
them to get out of there.&quot; Fex said to Layla, while pulling the
strings back, he also started to dash down the hallway, the students
began to imitate Fex's movements and ran off as well, following
behind him, going in his direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The large guard
followed them but with his heavy gear, he was quite slow. It seemed
like speed wasn't one of the attributes it had. Some users would
choose to focus on a set of beast armour that specialised in one
area. They would do this to make up what they were lacking for, or to
strengthen their strengths. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla watched the
two students turn the corner, they were now running down the same
hallway as Fex was running down just moments ago. Which meant soon
the large guard would turn the corner too. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a Sunday, and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, no.&quot;
With nothing left for her to do, she went to the closest room, opened
the door and stepped inside. She took a deep breath and held it in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of the
large guard's footsteps could be heard, as he ran around the corner
and continued to chase the two students. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she turned to
look around the corner, she noticed there was still another problem.
The second guard was still standing outside. As long as he was there,
Vorden and Quinn wouldn't be able to get inside. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She looked around to
see if there was anything she could do, the only thing she could see
was a plant pot down the hallway. Lifting it with her telekinesis
ability, she started to levitate it in the air, and floated it across
the hall towards the guard in green beast gear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The guard spotted it
floating about slowly coming towards him, but he remained at his post
in front of the door. When the pot was finally in front of his face,
he lashed out smashing it, and allowing it to drop to the floor. Yet
even then he still hadn't moved from his position. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like I'm

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No Vorden,
this whole plan depends on you, we need you to cause the biggest

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the meeting
room, Jack was preparing himself. He straightened up the tie on his
suit, and then licked his lips, making sure they weren't too dry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is always
the worst part,&quot; Jack said. He walked up to the first student,
and bent down, so the two of them were at eye level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His head was now
right next to the first student. Grabbing the person by the head, he
pulled it forward, pressing his lips against theirs, like he was
giving a kiss. Suddenly, Jack could feel the energy move from around
the whole student's body, as it started to enter into his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>About thirty seconds
had passed before Jack had removed his lips from the first student's.
He then spat on the ground, and wiped his lips with the sleeve of his
shirt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it, why
did my ability have to work in such a way!&quot; Jack said, annoyed.
The only way Jack was able to take the ability of another, was to
forcefully drain it through their open mouths. He had tried and
tested multiple different ways, but for some reason this was the only
way that worked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the stronger
abilities seemed to have certain restrictions. Similar to Vorden who
had to touch the other user before he could copy the ability, and how
it would only last up to twenty-four hours. One of the restrictions
on Jack's ability was that he could only steal someone's ability by
'kissing' them on their open mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, there was
nothing he could do about it, so he continued to go down the line
mechanically pressing his lips against each student to drain their
abilities. After each ability had been drained, he could feel them
swirling around inside his belly. Each of the forces were like little
flames all a little different from one another. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, he had
reached Erin. &quot;Now, here is someone I don't mind pressing my
lips against,&quot; Jack said as he looked at Erin's delicate face,
and realised she was a true beauty. It was a shame she was still so
young, otherwise he would have taken her back with him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The energy flowed
through Erin's body and slowly entered into Jack's. While doing so, a
slightly cold sensation was felt inside. When he removed his lips
from her, an icy breath was seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her ability had been
taken away, and it now remained inside Jack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now there was only
one student who was left, and that was Peter. As Jack looked at him,
he realised that Peter wasn't an attractive sight at all. His face
was sunken in, and he looked dehydrated almost like he was already
dead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In fact, if he
hadn't seen him moving earlier, he would have thought he was dead.
&quot;Alright last one.&quot; Jack then moved his face closer to
Peter, he closed his eyes as he went to press his lips to Peter's. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're awake,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A Strange shadow had
risen from the bottom of the door. Now it had completely covered it.
A few seconds had passed, and it looked like some type of shadow hand
had formed, reaching out to the Kenny, the guard in green beast gear.
He quickly reacted taking a few steps back, not allowing the hand to
touch him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had never seen
anything like it before, so he made sure to be cautious. It was a
phenomenon unknown to him, so first he needed to find out what it
did, before he could act accordingly. He took a single needle and
swirled it around in his mouth before throwing it towards the shadow,
but when the needle hit, strangely enough, there seemed to be no
reaction at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this
thing, is it some kind of ability?&quot; This was not good, judging
by the screams inside it was clear that one of the students was still
awake, if they were using their ability right now, it could be the
end of the Truedream family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course it was
Quinn, he had used his shadow cloak ability to sneak up to the
remaining guard in the hallway, and when he heard Jack Truedream
screaming for help, he had decided to distract the guard, to give
Vorden a chance to sneak into the room and take care of Jack. When he
started his shadow control ability, he had to drop his shadow cloak,
so the guard was going to notice him any second now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The guard started to
look around to see if there was any other way into the room and
that's when he spotted someone. A man dressed in all black suit of
armour, wearing a demon mask covering his face. Even the top of his
head was covered showing him the jagged white mechanical eyes of the
suit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it you?&quot;
The guard said. He knew he had to get inside quickly, because of the
main weakness his boss had. Which was that he couldn't use the
abilities he took from others, he was only able to give them to other
people. So at the moment, he was defenceless without his guards. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn said nothing
in response and started to dash forward, bringing the shadow from the
door back to him, it was now hovering above him. The guard saw this,
and immediately threw several needles but the shadow managed to block
them all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn quickly moved
to the side and pulled the shadow in close to him. Allowing the
needless to pass through and continue down the hallway. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it, this
is the problem going up against an original!&quot; The guard was
right. One of the main advantages one would have in a fight was
knowing the ability of the other. Using the information Logan had
given him, and his inspect skill. Quinn knew he couldn't chance
getting hit by those needles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wasn't sure if
his suit was strong enough to block them, so he would keep the shadow
close to himself for protection. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the guard saw
that his needles were ineffective, he quickly pulled out his dagger,
he was waiting for Quinn to get close. However, when they were around
nine meters apart, Quinn jumped into the air spinning his body and
then threw out a kick from the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A large crescent
shape line of red aura came out strong and fast. The man had never
expected this, he thought because the shadow was only used for
defence so far, it would now be used for an attack, so he was keeping
a keen eye on the shadow's movements. But instead, it looked like his
opponent was using a completely different ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could do nothing
but take the attack head-on, when the aura was directly in front of
him he struck at the red aura, which then shattered and disappeared. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn stood still
for a moment. His new skill was one of his strongest attacks when
comparing it to others. The only one stronger has his Blood Hammer.
Still, the person in front of him was easily able to shatter it with
his weapon, and there didn't seem to be a chip or anything on it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn spoke into the
mask which gave him an altered deep electronic voice. &quot;We know
what you have been doing. We from Pure have been following your
actions for a while now. We're here to save those kids from you!&quot;
Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now he was
improvising on the spot, and Logan was helping him with what to say.
The reason why Logan thought this would be their best option was so

true that Pure had informed them of Mr. Truedream's plans, but they

we don't have a clue about how his ability works, if it's like ours

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room was slowly
heating up as the flame started to spread from one piece of furniture
to the next. Soon the entire room would be engulfed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had already
left the room carrying Erin over his shoulder. He followed Logan's
instructions who was guiding him where to go, and was making sure
they would avoid the hallway where Quinn and Kenny were fighting
right now. The directions Logan was giving them, were to his own
room. Right now, it was the safest place he could think of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike the other
rooms that had routine check-ups now and then, Logan's room was
different. It was off limits most of the time. This was a special
request he made because of the number of different inventions he kept
in there. He was afraid that at any point in time someone would come
in, and possibly take one of his ideas for profit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, the
smoke had hit the detectors above, and the sprinklers had been
activated. However, the flames were too strong to completely get rid
of the fire. The sprinklers could only slow them down for now. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking around the
room, Jack could only see the students who were asleep in their
chairs, and was wondering what had caused the fire. However, when the
sprinklers had turned on, the drops of water bouncing off Vorden
formed a slight outline to be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden, or rather

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The strange shape
that Jack could see was standing right in front of him, if it wasn't
for this, he would have made a dash for the door. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Raten had made the
suggestion to kill Jack, but Vorden knew this wasn't an option. The
simple reason was the balance of the current world right now. If
Truedream were to die, it would go back to what it was like, straight
after the war. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the war had
ended, Earth was a mess. Ruined cities, the low population of animals
and a lot of the land had sunken into the sea. The whole human race
had been struck with poverty. Only there was a big difference now,
they had abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This, more than
anything, caused more infighting to happen than ever before, and
there was no control put in place. Eventually, the rise of the three
big families had come to create some type of order. But the
relationship between the three of them wasn't the best either, and
the fighting continued. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The military had
power, but they weren't strong enough. They would have many people
switching sides between them and the three families. That's why when
Truedream had come to them seeking support, it was a blessing. It was
someone the military could use to keep everyone in place, and it was
why it had been possible to put the current system in place. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Truedream was to
be taken out of the picture, the militaries power would weaken, and
the power balance would be upset again, leading to another civil war.
But that wasn't what worried Vorden the most. Civil wars happened,
and in the end, there would always be a winner that came out on top. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was, if

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I disagree,&quot;
Raten said. &quot;If the human race can't survive without one person,
then maybe we shouldn't be alive in the first place.&quot; Raten had
set his hand ablaze and threw a punch straight towards Jack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All Jack could see
right now was a floating arm of fire. He tried his best to move out
of the way, but the attack was clearly too fast. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As his hand full of
flames was about to hit, a slight reflection could be seen in front
of Jack. &quot;What the…&quot; Raten's hand had touched the
reflection, and it felt like he was hitting a solid wall. A
mysterious force then moved from the point where he had hit, and it
seemed to bounce off right back at Raten. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hugo?&quot;
Jack said. As he turned his head, the large guard, wielding the
two-handed axe had entered the room. &quot;Well, we know someone is
getting a raise.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn!&quot;
With nothing else left to do, Raten quickly headed for the corridor.
He didn't know Hugo's ability nor how strong he was. He loved
fighting but wasn't crazy enough not to know when chances were
against him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hugo the
door!&quot; Jack screamed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hugo held out his
hand, and another reflection appeared just in front of the door. But
it was too late. Jack could see the figure moving through the
sprinklers water, and it was clear it was no longer in the room with
them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it! You

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Raten ran down
the hallway, he could see Quinn was still busy dealing with the
smaller guard, Kenny. &quot;I'm leaving!&quot; He shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And that was the
signal for Quinn to disappear as well. Using his shadow cloak skill,
suddenly he had disappeared right in front of Kenny's eyes. A few
seconds later and Jack and Hugo had already come out of the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where the hell

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead of listening
to Jack's words though, Kenny immediately ran back into the room they
had exited from. He ignored both Jack and Hugo. The fire was still
burning in the room, and the students were still asleep under his
abilities effect. He lifted two of them on each shoulder and took
them out of the room, placing them on the ground gently. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then did the same
with the other four, and eventually, guards from the base, had
arrived to help extinguish the fire. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack then walked up
to Kenny, he lifted his hand and whacked him across the face giving
him a big slap. &quot;Did I say to save those students lives, you let
them get away. If you don't have any information or good news, you
know what will happen to you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking at the
kids all safe out of the room, Kenny had a smile on his face.
Although Jack was unable to see this due to the mask covering his
mouth. &quot;Sir, it seems like there were a few of them. I'm not
sure how many but there were at least two of them. They claimed to be
from Pure and were trying to save the kids.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

been tailing me for months but never acted out, this is a first for

We'll head back for now, I can't risk staying here any longer,&quot;
Jack said. &quot;But before we go, send a report to Duke. They want
to save the kids that badly, well I won't let them have their way. If
Duke is to find either of those two students, they are to be sent to
me immediately, you understand?!&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the three of them
walked off, Logan's mechanical spider had done the same. It had also
listened to all the words that had been said by Jack just now. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a few minutes,
everyone had returned and entered Logan's room. Vorden, Peter, Layla,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We did it!&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Man, that big

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wouldn't

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what are

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla's hands were

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know a

certain group of people, they will be able to help her, actually
I'm...&quot; She paused for a moment, gathering her courage before
saying the last words, &quot;I'm from that group… I'm from Pure. It
was me who wrote that letter included with the nano stick.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I knew it!&quot;
Vorden shouted. &quot;Of course, she was hiding something. Why else
would she willingly help Quinn, and accept the truth of his identity?
They probably wanted to use him for some reason.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's not
true!&quot; Layla snapped back.&quot; They don't even know about
Quinn, I never told them! I didn't ask for this, I didn't ask for any
of this!&quot; Layla shouted, as tears started to run down her face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn saw the
tension between them and decided to intervene, he placed himself
between Layla and Vorden. He had done this because it seemed like
Vorden was going to lash out at her any second, at least if someone
didn't interfere soon, so he did. He proceeded to lead her over to
the bed, and sat her down next to Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry guys,
but can someone explain to me what or who Pure is?&quot; Fex said,
bearing a confused look on his face, as he stood in the corner of the
room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm glad you
asked,&quot; Logan said, spinning his chair around to ready a file to
display. He then opened it while uttering, &quot;I prepared for this
after I saw Layla dropping off the note in the morning.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You knew?&quot;
Vorden said, surprised. &quot;Why didn't you tell us?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Was it
important to the mission?&quot; Logan replied. &quot;Regardless if
she is part of Pure or not, it was thanks to her information, that we
were able to get those two out of there. True, she might have an
ulterior motive, but why would she reveal herself now? There is no
need to, unless she truly wishes to help.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Logan knew
there was some truth in his words, he couldn't help but think that
she had kept it a secret for this long. It was contrary to Quinn's
prompt revelation that he was a vampire. Something just didn't feel
right about that, and the things he had heard about Pure weren't the
best either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In an instant, a
projection was seen playing a myriad of different videos. It was
mostly of people wearing a type of mask that covered their whole
face. All with a figure of an angel that looked like it had its wings
removed. It was the mark of Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the video, it
showed multiple explosions from bomb attacks on important buildings
and several different guilds they had conducted. It wasn't a pretty
sight at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me warn
all of you. What you are seeing now is pretty biased. Pure has only
one goal. To get rid of all abilities and their users. They believe
that the current world and the system that's in place are wrong. Even
before abilities were introduced, there were many who complained
about the gap between the rich and the poor. However, now they feel
like even basic human rights don't exist for those with a weak or
even no ability.&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Which is
pretty stupid, if you ask me,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;It was only
thanks to those with abilities that we were able to battle the Dalki.
If we get rid of them, what do they want us to do? There are only a
few people who would be able to kill beasts without the use of
abilities in the first place. That is unless you're not human, of
course.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These reasons were
why Vorden was so suspicious of Layla. To him it made sense. A race
exists that is stronger than humans, that don't rely on abilities.
Although even the vampires had different levels, Vorden wouldn't be
surprised if Pure didn't think ahead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, there is
something that I don't understand,&quot; Fex said. &quot;If Pure is a
group of people who hate abilities, and Layla is one of them, then
why does she have an ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone then turned
to look at Layla as they loved to hear the answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I didn't mean
to deceive any of you. My situation here is quite complicated.&quot;
Layla began to reason, &quot;As Logan explained, you all know what
our goal is. Currently, the world is in balance, but we don't agree
with the system that is in place, and the main culprit of that is the
military. However, the only reason they can enforce the rules is
because of Jack Truedream. But at the same time, Truedream is also a
blessing to Pure. For he's the only person that can take anyone's
ability away, without killing them that is.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla sighed after
her lengthy explanation, as she gazed at each and every one of her
comrades in turn, after a few seconds had passed she continued her
speech. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Truedream
often visits this military base, more often than he visits the other
bases. We have agents stationed at every base, but only at this have
all of them disappeared, not one of them ever came back. Accordingly,
they decided to change tactics, and wanted a student to infiltrate
this military base.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And they sent
in a child?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;Seems like a good place to send
Erin then, doesn't it?&quot; He continued with a sarcastic tone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I
volunteered!&quot; Layla shouted, yet her eye slightly twitched when
she said those words. Because the truth was she didn't volunteer
herself for this mission, but it was her mother who offered her own
daughter to Pure, just for her own benefit. &quot;Look, this isn't
about me and Pure. This matter is about Erin. Right now, she doesn't
have an ability, Truedream has been known for doing this to people,
and we've taken them in, we still looked out for them when others
didn't. We will do the same for Erin.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then dragged
Quinn towards the side and whispered in his ear. &quot;You're not
really considering this, are you? For Erin and Peter to go over to
Pure?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was struggling
to arrive at a conclusion. He was pretty sure that Layla meant no
harm, yet putting his friends in the hand of strangers, and sending
Peter away would be a huge risk. Without Quinn by his side, his evil
nature would take over. Moreover, if they ever found out who he was,
it would be no better than the school finding out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it was
different with Erin. Quinn then shifted his stare towards Logan
asking, &quot;Logan, don't you have everything that happened
recorded? Can't we just use that as blackmail material against
Truedream? Spread it on the internet or something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Impossible,&quot;
Logan replied without delay. &quot;You remember the reports I brought
up earlier? It's clear that the military has a monopoly on what can
be seen and what cannot. It would be taken down in an instant, and no
one would want to host such a thing. They would be going up against
two of the biggest powers in the world. No one would take the risk of
going up against them. I'm sorry but I wouldn't want to risk the
safety of my family by angering them.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Logan
enlightened them of the situation, Vorden started to think about his
own family. The sole problem was that he wasn't on good terms with
them at all. No one in his family would listen to him, much more do
him a favour. It wasn't the Blade family's way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we
have no other choice,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;For Erin, the best
thing will be to go over to Pure for protection. Erin and Layla are
close, so if Layla had bad intentions, the last person she would want
to hurt is Erin.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait! Only
Erin?&quot; Layla asked surprised. &quot;But what about Peter? He can
come too.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn shook his head
as he looked at Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He can't, and
Vorden and Fex probably already know the reason why,&quot; Quinn
explained. &quot;Peter has changed, Layla. If he isn't next to me,
then there's no telling what he will do.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then looked at
Peter. Although his physical appearance had changed a little, she
hadn't been around him enough lately to notice any changes to his
personality. Still, when she looked into his eyes, she noticed that
they were cold and lifeless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, so Erin
goes to Pure,&quot; Vorden stated. &quot;What about Peter?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's mind had
already been working overtime as he tried to think of solutions, but
at that moment, he was out of ideas. The only thing they could do was
to hide him for as long as possible, or they could opt to utilize

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just when Quinn was
in the middle of contemplating what to do with Peter. It seemed like
the system had an answer. Although, whenever the system chimed in, it
was never straight-up good news, there was always a catch, so he was
a little nervous. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean you have an idea for Peter?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The main issue
right now is that they can't show their faces in the school anymore,
because the military will be trying to get rid of them. At the same
time, Peter won't be able to leave the military base due to the fear
of him running wild. But we have one solution available for Peter
that will solve both of these problems.&quot; The system explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, Quinn was
waiting for the worrisome part. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He can learn a
transformation ability. Ever since you turned him... He lost his
original powers, and his body is now different from what it once was,
meaning he can now learn another ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But I thought
you said we had to find a specific ability that could be learned for
vampires. Just like mine with the shadow book. At the time not a
single one reacted when I touched it only the shadow one did.&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perhaps I need
to remind you once again. What I said was that there are certain
abilities that only vampires can learn, and at the same time there
are abilities that only humans can learn. However, there are also
abilities that are in the middle, somewhere in between that both can
learn, and one of them is the transformation ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The transformation
ability wasn't a popular ability with the general public. It didn't
give the user anything that could be used in combat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, it was
looked down upon by a lot of the people. Still, it did have its uses.
With the transformation ability, one could alter their body and face,
and look like someone else, however to change the body a very high
level of transformation ability was needed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This meant it was
often used for infiltration or spying. The problem was whenever these
people were discovered, they would be killed in an instant, due to
the fact that a transformation ability does not grant them any
offensive or even defensive capabilities at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why didn't you
suggest this before?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Before, I felt
like it would be more beneficial for you to wait for a more powerful
ability to pop up. One that would make Peter and thereby you,
stronger. But right now, it's more important than anything at this
moment that Peter won't get caught.&quot; The system explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then explained
to the others what his plan was for Peter. How that since he had
turned into a vampire-kind he still hadn't learned an ability, so
that he could now learn a new one, and that he should be able to
learn the transformation ability. Still, there was one problem with
the whole thing, and solving it relied on Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn needed Logan's
help... Even if Peter could transform and disguise himself. When he
appeared as a new student the entire school would immediately know,
and he also couldn't pretend to be someone else since that would be
too obvious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what do you
think Logan?&quot; Quinn asked. &quot;Will you be able to hack into
the school system and add a new ID for him?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The problem
isn't whether I can do it or not Quinn.&quot; Logan replied.
&quot;Obviously I can. That's like asking if a bee can make honey.
The problem is making it all seem natural. Say there are five hundred
first year students. Then one day suddenly there are five hundred and
one students. The new kid turns up to class and everyone is just
meant to accept it. It won't work.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, the
group were deep in thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have an
idea,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;When we went to the planet Caladi and
the Dalki attacked us. Didn't they say they couldn't find three of
the student's bodies?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's right,&quot;
Layla replied. &quot;They assumed they had died somewhere deep in the
desert, and that their bodies were eaten.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this started
to bring back memories for Quinn. The truth was the Dalki hadn't
killed them. It was him that killed them. Although no one knew about
this fact yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, once
Peter learns the transformation ability, why don't we get him to look
like one of those students. We can have him appear back near the
portal and say he had gotten lost in the desert and had only found
his way back now.&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, that is
big brain thinking.&quot; Logan said. He then hopped onto his
computer and went over to the market place in search for a
transformation ability book. It had to be one of a high level to be
able to get the finer details right in the facial structure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It didn't take long
for Logan to find one, due to how unpopular the skill. It seemed to
be a level 5 skill which was perfect. It would be good enough for
Peter to look nearly identical to one of the students and with
Peter's mutant cells being slightly different it wouldn't show his
real level on the watch anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only displaying the
fake number Logan had put in. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ability book
purchased!&quot; Logan exclaimed </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Logan...
You didn't have to do that, I could have paid for it.&quot; Quinn
said feeling bad at how much money Logan had spent on him now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
Quinn. I'm involved in this too now, and if I didn't want to do it, I
would have kicked you all out of this room. Besides who said I wasn't
keeping a tab? I do have to warn you that I do charge quite the
interest.&quot; Logan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was hard for
Quinn to tell whether Logan was joking about the whole thing or not. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he said these
words his expression never changed once. But Quinn would have liked
to think he was cracking a joke, it was nice seeing Logan trying to
fit in. But this was a different matter… Quinn didn't want his
wallet to take a hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After purchasing the
book and entering the code, it had arrived in only a few seconds
right into Logan's room. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It will
probably take him a few weeks or so to learn it,&quot; Logan said.
&quot;For now he can stay in my room. Luckily he doesn't need any
food or anything so as long as he stays here he'll be fine.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't like
the idea of that. He could imagine either Peter accidentally touching
one of Logan's prized possession and getting a laser beam shot
through his chest. Or Logan would say something that caused Peter to
snap. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me try

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Peter
didn't have a system ability, Quinn had a feeling something like this

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others watching

only able to imitate a person's facial structure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the current
level of his ability, there wasn't anything he could do to mimic a
person's height or physical appearance. This also meant that he
wouldn't be able to pretend to be a girl unless one had the same body
type as his. To allay suspicion, Logan decided to pick the student
who was closest in height and body type to Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of the three,
there were two that matched Peter closely. Now when making a decision
between which one, Logan opted for the one with a less known
background and with an ability they could pass off, and wouldn't
cause too much trouble. He decided to go for the duplication ability
user. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this Quinn
wanted to protest to this idea. Out of the three men from Ben's group
that had attacked him in the desert that day. Two had died, while one
had lived. The one that lived was also the one that Logan was now
suggesting for Peter to mimic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had left him
in the desert after removing his memory, but he had never come back,
nor did the search party find him. Perhaps while he was laying down
unconscious on the desert floor a beast really had come and killed
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After thinking about
it, he realised if he hadn't come back by now, the chances were
really low of the person returning. Most likely he was already dead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter looked at the
screen and carefully started to morph his face. The student had
medium length brown hair, and one of the finer details about him was
he would often wear a bandana that cut off one side of his hair while
the other remained up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, Peter would
no longer go by his own name while in the school and now would be
known as Pio Blank. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn took a long
stare at Peter and came to the conclusion that this might actually be
the best option for him. He had to look at Peter in his new form
every day, if he looked like someone whom Quinn had killed or had let
die, he didn't know how that would make him feel. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While all of this
was happening, the groans from the back were heard as Erin lifted her
body off the bed, and started to touch her head. It was ringing with
a dull pain, and her face felt slightly numb, similar to the feeling
of a migraine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When she looked up
she could see the faces of everyone in their group, staring at her,
but she also saw a person she had never seen before, this slightly
puzzled her, because she didn't see Peter anywhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who the heck
is the new guy?&quot; Erin asked groggily, not making the connection
because she still wasn't fully there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No one said a word
and after a few moments, she started to remember everything that
happened to her. Her last words with Jack, and what he had suggested
to them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No! No! No!&quot;
She started to scream. There was no need for her to try to use her
ability. She could feel that it was no longer with her. But just in
case she tried to form ice in her hand. She tried again and again,
but the result stayed the same, she couldn't do it anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Calm her down,
before someone outside hears us,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla quickly rushed
over to her side, but Erin couldn't help but scream in anger and
sadness. The others had never seen this side of Erin before. It was
different for most of them who had been weak their whole life. If
their powers were taken away it wouldn't make much of a difference. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But for Erin, she
was high up. Of course, the others didn't know the full story, and
just how much being strong meant to her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you really
want us to be caught?&quot; Logan said as he threw out a circular
device towards Erin. The device opened up mid-air just before
reaching her face and it wrapped around her head and mouth, like a
tight fitting mask. The screams had stopped but the tears still
continued to run down her face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Erin I know
you are upset but right now your situation involves all of us,&quot;
Logan explained. &quot;I can't have your selfish actions harm me or
the others, now Layla I believe you would be the best person to
explain to her what we have planned.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Erin's mouth
was covered, it was a lot easier for Layla to explain. It didn't give
Erin any option to complain, and it allowed Layla to explain
everything without her getting in between. How Jack had sent out a
search party for her and Peter, how she was part of Pure, and that
they would be sending her to Pure for protection. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then walked up
to Erin, and before taking the device off her mouth, he had a few
things to say himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now if you
scream, it goes back on. The situation is not favourable for any of
us, and please trust me. We went through all the options. I even
looked into your background and thought about seeing if we could send
you back to your family. But that's not possible,&quot; Logan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Staying with
Pure is the only option we currently have.&quot; Logan took off
Erin's wristwatch and made a few adjustments to it before placing it
back. &quot;We are a bit wary of Pure so if you need any help in an
emergency you can contact me through that, although I doubt we will
be able to do much. Do you understand?&quot; He asked as he finished
his monologue. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin nodded calmly.
Rather than angry or sad she seemed to be going through a different
stage right now, she seemed to be in shock. As soon as the mask was
taken off she looked at Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Will you be
coming with me?&quot; Erin asked with pain in her voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla looked in her
eyes and held both of her hands before shaking her head, she knew the
next words would hit her hard. &quot;No I can't, I still have my
mission here,&quot; Layla replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment Erin
snapped her hands back. Everything was getting a little too much for
her. Her abilities had been taken, she was being treated as a convict
by the school, Jack was possibly after her life, and now she had no
choice but to join a terrorist group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Why did this have to
happen to her? Was it just her bad luck? Then she started to remember
there was one more person in the same situation as her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about
Peter, will he be coming along with me as well?&quot; Although Erin
didn't get along that well with Peter, if she was going through this
struggle with someone she knew it would at least be better than going
through it alone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student who Erin
didn't recognize, which was standing next to Quinn, then stepped
forward and his face started to morph back into his old face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But how?
Didn't he have an earth ability before?&quot; Erin asked. &quot;How
did he learn that?&quot; The sound of a little excitement could be
felt in her voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's because
Peter is no longer human,&quot; Quinn explained. &quot;When a human
turns into a vampire or a vampire subclass they lose their old
ability as their body changes. Logan's guess is it has something to
do with the cells in the body being different. Essentially it's like
getting a new body so Peter was able to learn a new ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing these words
from Quinn's mouth, suddenly gave Erin an idea. She had lost her
ability but not all hope was gone. If what Quinn was saying was
correct, there was still a chance for her to get her powers back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She stood up from
the bed and said… &quot;Quinn, I want you to make me a vampire. I
want you to turn me like how you turned Peter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing how
Peter was able to obtain a new ability, Erin started to gain hope
again, so in her haste, she had blurted out her question. If there
was a way for her to get her powers back, a chance no matter how
small to return to her former self, then she would take it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before she would
have never considered it. There were too many downsides she saw both
Peter and Quinn deal with. As long as she grew her ice abilities
slowly with higher grade ability books, or if she were to find a good
teacher. She would be able to progress up the ranks, and eventually
become a force to be reckoned with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, right now
that wasn't the case, and her best option was right in front of her.
What she didn't realize though was the grave mistake that she had
just committed. When asking Quinn to turn her, she had mentioned a
particular detail that someone in the room hadn't been quite sure
about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even now Quinn was
peeking at Fex out of the corner of his eyes. Seeing just what his
reaction might be. Many times before Fex had mentioned the fact that
he thought Peter had been created by an irresponsible leader. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Fex didn't
have much of a reaction. He continued to stand there no different
than before. The reason being that he had already assumed Quinn was
the one who turned Peter. He wouldn't have been so loyal without his
master by his side. It also explained why Quinn wasn't so trusting of
Fex in the first place, other than about his shadow ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was illegal
and if the council ever found out about Peter, both of them would be
executed. The reason why Fex didn't have much of a reaction to what
Erin was suggesting though was actually because of the limits a
normal vampire has. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even without the
laws, a regular vampire could turn at most one person. Someone like
Fex could turn two, and he would be given permission to do so when he
ascended to the rank of Noble. He knew Quinn's strength, and never
thought he would be able to turn more than one person, so Erin's
suggestion meant nothing to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing that Fex
wasn't making a big deal out of everything, Quinn decided to continue
on. &quot;Erin even if I wanted to, I can't. It wouldn't change the
situation we are in anyway,&quot; Quinn explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; she asked, slightly annoyed taking a step forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like Erin
was starting to regain her confidence back, seeing from her snappy
response to him, but Quinn could also tell this meant her emotions
were all over the place, and she was still very unstable. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Taking a step back,
Quinn tried his best to explain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First I think
you're forgetting the main issue here. It isn't that your ability was
stolen from you, but it's the fact that the school and Jack are after
you. Either way, we need to hide you somewhere, and going to Pure is
the best option we have right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I was to
turn you, and you were to turn into a ghoul like Peter, or maybe
something else. Once they found out, who knows what they would do to
you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Layla felt
a little hurt about the others talking badly about the organization
she was in, at the same time she couldn't really dispute their
reasons, or argue her case. If they did find out Erin was a type of
vampire, beings they didn't even know about. Who knows what they
would do to her, even Layla didn't know. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And the last
issue, say you turned into a vampire, then what? Do you really want
the same ability as Peter? To transform. I would have thought you
would have at least wanted something similar if not better than your
ice abilities.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex can just
teach me his string ability, or your shadow ability looks nice as
well.&quot; Erin snapped back. Forgetting about the first point Quinn
had made and only focusing on the fact that Quinn was able to help
her gain power. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Erin didn't
know was Quinn had learnt his ability through an unusual method. He
hadn't practised the techniques written down in a book. Everything
just worked through the system. There was no way for him to explain
or teach someone how to use the shadow ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And unless Erin was
a part of Fex's family. He wouldn't be happy to teach her to use his
strings either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perhaps I
should take over the explaining,&quot; Logan said as he moved
forward. &quot;The reason Peter got the transformation ability in the
first place, was so he could hide in plain sight. We are currently
using one of the missing male students from the planet Caladi. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If you did change
your mind and gave in, ending up with the transformation ability, it
would still be impossible to hide you, Erin. There have been no
missing female students since the start of the term. They find you,
and you will be taken to the dungeon. If Pure find out that you have
been turned into a vampire, you will probably experience an even
worse fate.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing their
explanation wasn't calming Erin down at all, but instead, it was
making her feel drained and defeated. She thought that perhaps Quinn
was her way out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's the
point of me being protected by Pure, am I meant to just be some type
of princess that can't fight for herself?&quot; she complained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It won't be
like that,&quot; Layla replied. &quot;There are many people in Pure
who are of equal strength to those with powers to the outside. Look
at our leader for a clear example.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Pure leader was
well known around the world and that was mainly because of one
reason. They were one of the only two people currently in the world
to possess a demon class weapon. The highest tiered beast weapon that
is currently known. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now Quinn
could see that Layla was acting rash. And perhaps wasn't thinking
properly so he thought there might be just one thing he could say to
calm her down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why don't we
make a deal?&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Stay with Pure for now, once
this whole thing blows over or we finish school, come back to me. If
you still wish for me to turn you into a vampire, then I will. Please
understand Erin, none of us can do anything when we are dead.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She looked into his
eyes for a while before eventually giving his answer, and finally
shook Quinn's hand. &quot;Sometimes you actually make some sense,&quot;
She said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the matter
had been settled and they had decided on their plan. Peter would at
some point appear in the portal room, claiming to be Pio, the student
who had gone missing on the last outing. While Erin would go to Pure
for now, then perhaps return to Quinn's side in the future. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do we
need to do to send Erin to Pure then?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;It's
not exactly like we can just walk out the front door of this place.
Students have tried leaving before and it's nearly impossible.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Logan do you
have a solution for this?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Unfortunately
not,&quot; Logan replied. &quot;These military bases are strange.
Quite honestly, even I don't know where we are located at the moment.
I can disable the tracker and you can try going outside, but we need
a vehicle of some sort or maybe we might need a ship depending on
where we are.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have Pure
members stationed on nearly every Planet, except for a few red
planets,&quot; Layla said. &quot;We won't need to go outside but just
get Erin to the portal room.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's no
good,&quot; Logan said. &quot;It seems like after the incident last
time with a couple of students being pushed into one of the portals.
They have been stricter about the security there.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden and Quinn
gave each other a quick glance before both turning their heads at
Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking around
the room and for a solution, Fex spotted the strange square-shaped
device that was located in Logan's room. He noticed it almost
instantly. It was a teleporter but not just any type. It was the same
type of teleporters they used on his own planet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But this wouldn't be
of any help to them at all. The last place Fex wanted to go to was
back home, and the others would be made into food in an instant if
they were taken there. However, he did decide to make note of where
it was, just in case he ever wanted to go back home. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How about
Fex's mind control?&quot; Erin said. &quot;Couldn't he tell them to
go away or remove their memories?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If they are
adults it would be much harder than before,&quot; Fex replied.
&quot;Besides, right now I'm guessing there will be a lot of people
covering that area. If I wanted to get out of this place the portal
room would be the first place I would think of too. So there's no way
we can pull off something similar again, like we did against
Truedream. Not unless we had someone on the inside.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last words Fex
had spoken gave Quinn an idea. It was a risky one, but he had a
feeling in his gut that he could trust this person, and that he would
be able to help. He was already keeping a huge secret of Quinn's so
there was already some trust between them, and he felt like if there
was one person that was on the right side of justice, it would be
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then we have
no choice,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;We need to ask Leo for help.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The words that had
come out of Quinn's mouth came as a surprise to all of them. This
included even Vorden who felt like he was the closest to Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why would you
suggest that?&quot; Vorden said. &quot;Leo is a sergeant, and
although he isn't under Duke, he is under Nathan, who is ultimately
under Paul, the head general. It's clear that Leo is working for
them.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a simple
deduction that Vorden had made, and it would be right to assume so.
But Quinn didn't believe it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, maybe I
can change your mind about him,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;First of all,
I'm pretty sure he knows I'm a vampire, no actually, let me change
that. I'm a hundred percent sure he knows I'm not human, and the same
could be said for Fex and Peter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait a
minute,&quot; Erin called out. &quot;Is that why he gives you special
treatment. It's starting to make sense now that I think about it.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not sure
about that one,&quot; Quinn said, letting out a chuckle. &quot;But
I'm sure his ability has something to do with it. He knew I was
different from the beginning and has safeguarded my secret until this
day. Leo is different from the other teachers. He once asked me
something, inquiring about whose side I was on. It started to make me
think and ponder about a couple of things.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo himself doesn't
align with the military; he is on the side of humanity. As long as
there is a threat to humanity, he will protect us.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then quickly
hopped onto his computer and started to type, checking to see if
there was any information he could bring up on Leo, if at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, is this a
hunch?&quot; Vorden inquired. &quot;Isn't it too risky to go on this
journey just based on a hunch?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I too am in
favour of talking to Leo, I think it is a good idea,&quot; Erin
added. &quot;I agree he's different from the other teachers. Remember
how he saved us from the Dalki attack that one time? And during our
lessons, he would continuously give me tips about my swordsmanship.
Also, it seemed he treated everyone the same, no matter what. The way
he acted just doesn't fit in with the way the world is right now.
Usually, a teacher would choose to focus only on the promising
students but, he never did anything of the sort, except playing
favourites with Quinn a little. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I respect him
as a teacher, and if me leaving this place is based on whether or not
we can trust Leo, then I would bet on him over any of the other
teachers.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Isn't Leo the
guy I fought with?&quot; Fex said. &quot;I mean if it's him, he
seemed like a pretty cool guy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know, but we
don't go trusting people based on how cool they are.&quot; Vorden
replied, starting to get a little annoyed that people didn't seem to
see reason. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess you're
right,&quot; Fex replied. &quot;Otherwise, you guys would have
trusted me from the beginning, right?&quot; He said as he swiped back
a single strand of hair that had appeared in front of his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Totally ignoring
him, Logan projected the information about Leo onto the screen. Most
of the news articles and information about Leo had to do with his
accomplishments during the last war. He stood out due to the amount
of Dalki he had managed to kill despite being a lowly private at the
time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Here you go,&quot;
Logan said. &quot;It looks like you might be onto something after
all. It says Leo readily refused to join the military and only wanted
peace after the war. However, he did agree to fight once again if the
Dalki were to invade. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At the time,
Leo was a bit of a lone wolf who had refused to join any factions,
including the Big Four. The military saw this as a chance to grab him
up, but it proved difficult. In the end, Leo agreed if they granted a
request: he would join the military if he could be a teacher. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Judging by
this, it is as you say; perhaps, he isn't as closely aligned with the
military as the others from here are.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a risk, and
others knew it would be but, if Erin was happy to go through with it,
then she should at least have some say in what they were planning to
do with her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Logan
leapt out of his chair and started to search around his room for some
items. He went through crates and crates of stuff until he had
finally found what was looking for. The projector that had been used
to display the holograms so far started to display a solid wall of
green. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Which one of
you is the best at acting here?&quot; Logan inquired. The others
didn't know who to look at but eventually, they all directed their
gazes at Vorden. Even Quinn didn't know why but, based on the
numerous ways Vorden could express himself, he felt him to be the
perfect fit for the task at hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then walked up
to Vorden, and without even asking for his consent, he tried to put
the strange-looking helmet device on his head. Unfortunately, there
was quite a height difference between the two, so it was a struggle
for Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can't you see
what I'm trying to do? Bend down, you dumb giant!&quot; Logan
shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden immediately
bent down a little as Logan placed the strange helmet on his face.
The helmet mainly went around his forehead and had unusual mechanical
arms that came outward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Even if you go
to Leo and he agrees to help, the security around everywhere is going
to be tough. This is the only thing I can think of which might get
them to lower their guard a bit.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This strange
helmet thing?&quot; Vorden replied, with a tone of incredulity in his
voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This here is a
facial recognition device. It is able to track the smallest of
details and all the little movements of the muscles in your face.
What I plan to do is make a video. If we put both Peter and Erin up

able to create a realistic video. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The plan is to
pretend the video has been sent from Pure, informing the school that
the kids they are looking for have already left the planet and are
safely in Pure's hands. That strange helmet device and the green
backdrop is so I can change your appearance to whoever I like, the
same with the background,&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Once they know
Pure safely has the two of you. Hopefully, they will stop searching
around as desperately as they are doing now,&quot; He finished. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn felt amazed by
Logan's thinking ability, and thought of all the things he could do
with him. He was lucky to have someone like him on his side, and
would hate to think what it would be like to have him as an enemy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A speech was made
for Vorden to act out, while Layla was in charge of telling Vorden
what to say to make the video sound more authentic. It made the most

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

the Layla they thought they knew, wasn't real at all. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video was
finished, and it was now time to enact their plan. Logan would stay
in his room, and would make sure the file got to the school, while
Peter and Erin would hide themselves somewhere in Logan's room, and

had her own task to accomplish. She had to inform Pure of the plan to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently inside
Logan's room were Fex, Erin, Peter, and Logan. There was no
conversation between them, they were all just silently standing
around. They hadn't realised it until now, but the thing that brought
most of them together was Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others didn't
really know each other that well, and without him there they didn't
have anything to talk about with each other. This didn't seem to
bother Logan much, the only sound that could be heard was him typing
away on his computer, trying to gain access to the military bases
systems, and find a way to upload the video they had made without
leaving any traces. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex, on the other
hand, was keeping a close eye on Peter. Without Quinn there, Fex felt
like it was his duty to protect all of them, in the case of Peter
losing control. Though Fex thought that perhaps Logan would be able
to deal with Peter on his own as well. He knew first-hand how strong
the shots from that strange suit were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While staring at
Peter, Fex was trying to figure out just who Quinn was. Right now he
had two main theories, one of them was that he was a member of one of
the thirteen families raised here on earth since birth and reported
back to the main family once in a while. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And while he was
down here, he had made the mistake of turning Peter, and was now
trying to keep it a secret. But the thing that threw him off with
this theory was his ability, the shadow ability. His first thought
was that one of the families was keeping it a secret from the rest.
So that when the crowning of a new king or queen was to happen again,
it would give them quite the power advantage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His other theory
was, Quinn didn't belong to any of the thirteen vampire families and
instead belonged to them, the original shadow users. However, this
theory of his was the most outlandish for they were meant to be long
dead. And if it was true he wouldn't be able to even imagine the
consequences. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the vampire
council found out they hadn't all died, then there would be chaos. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Walking down the
hallway, both Quinn and Vorden were making their way to the weapons
class. Even on off days like today, Leo would often be there taking
care of the equipment, or just practise his swordsmanship. It wasn't
hard to say that Leo was a workaholic, except that he wasn't really
doing it for work reasons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But there were times
when Quinn and others around him could see that Leo was obsessed with
the blade, but that wasn't quite right either. Leo was actually
obsessed with getting revenge against the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While walking
around, they could see the panic in the soldier's faces. The
students, who were outside the campus and around the city, had been
ordered to come back and remain inside the school. The military had
taken action immediately after Jack Truedream had left. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a strict
border control being held just around the school, with soldiers
surrounding the whole place in a circle. Even on their way to the
martial arts hall, Quinn and Vorden were both questioned several
times. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them now
stood just outside the weapons hall, and Vorden hesitated before
stepping in. &quot;Quinn, this is our last chance. Are you really
sure about this? What do we do if he doesn't agree? I don't think
we're strong enough to take him on.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Even if he
doesn't agree, he's not the type to turn us in for protecting a
friend. He'll understand. Trust me.&quot; With that, Quinn stepped
forward, full of confidence, opening the door into the martial arts
hall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the weekend,
so no students were inside, but Leo was there, standing in the middle
of the room on his own. Sweat was dripping down from his forehead
while his sword was still sheathed at his waist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the two
of them entered the room, he was already looking in their direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The two of you
were standing outside for a while. I was wondering when you were
going to come in,&quot; Leo said with a slight smile on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is this guy really
blind?' Vorden thought to himself. There weren't many opportunities
where both Vorden and Leo were able to be around each other. Vorden
knew about his accomplishments during the war, but sometimes, the
rumours would often be exaggerated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I wonder if I could
even touch him,' Vorden mused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two of them
got closer, Leo could tell that the energy inside the two of them was
disturbed, but while looking at Vorden, his energy flow seemed
strange. Had he met this person before? Because right now, he was
looking at a person that had two different flows of energy inside
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was because
Vorden currently held the fire ability, as well as the invisibility
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Leo, I know
you have already done me a huge favour by keeping my secret,&quot;
Quinn spoke. &quot;And because of this, I have decided to trust you
with something else. I hope my hunch isn't wrong and I hope you can
help me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't make
any promises as I do not know what you wish to tell me,&quot; Leo
said. &quot;But as long as you are not in the wrong, you have nothing
to worry about.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Leo spoke those
last words, it gave Vorden a little shiver down his spine. Just what
had this man gone through to be able to create such an intense
feeling with only a few words? Was it his ability? Or was it really
just the pressure emitting from this person? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
explain what had happened, and how they had learned of what
Truedream's real reason for coming to the academy was. As well as how
someone from Pure was the one who had informed them, and how their
friends had been chosen for the process. And he finished explaining
that all they wanted to do was protect Erin and Peter from the
military and from Truedream. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn did
leave out some of the details regarding them, trying to save Peter
for a different reason, than that Peter was related to himself, and
just explained that he didn't want his friends to lose their ability.
He also mentioned how they needed to send Erin out of here right now.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After they had
finished explaining, both Quinn and Vorden were very nervous, so they
took a deep breath, trying to calm themselves down. They carefully
watched where Leo's hands were placed, thinking that any second now,
he would go for his blade and capture the two of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You two can
calm down,&quot; Leo said. &quot;As I've said to both of you before,
as long as you are not in the wrong, I shall help. And in this
situation, I believe you are not in the wrong.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn spoke
about everything that had happened to Truedream, Leo had made sure to
carefully keep an eye on their energy flow, as well as on their
heartbeat. He noticed quite often when people were lying, their flow
of energy, as well as their heartbeat, would fluctuate slightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Over the years, it
came to the point where Leo was just as good as any lie detector. Of
course, there were those who had a solid will and had been trained to
the point where it wouldn't affect them anymore. But for kids like
these, it was easy for him to tell. He knew that the words Quinn
spoke were the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, can you
help us?&quot; Quinn asked with a little smile on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There isn't
much I can do about the situation with Jack. Although he isn't part
of the military, he is treated a lot higher than me. When I arrived
here, I was adamant to be put under Nathan since I had an odd feeling
about Duke, this now explains it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Right now,
because of my rank, there isn't much I can do. Jack holds a special
relationship with our head general Paul. The only thing I can do is
wait to meet with the head general of military base one. Not everyone
in the military agrees with Jack's doing, and this will hopefully be
a step in the right direction.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Leo was doing
right now was a risk most people would never take. If someone were to
find out that they were trying to ruin the relationship between Jack
and the military, there would be many people on both sides upset with
this, and most likely, many would go after Leo's life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What he was doing
right now was fearless, and Leo didn't have a group or other people
backing him, but he only had himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about that,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Right now, all we need to do is
save our friends. Is there any way you can get us inside the portal
room to send her off somewhere?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo started to
think, which they thought wasn't a good sign. It seemed like he had
asked a simple yes or no question, but seeing Leo think, didn't seem
to be the case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you know,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since they made the
decision to ask Pure for help, she had been thinking how she could
explain her actions, because she knew she had broken the rules of
Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Entering her own
room this time, Layla was more nervous than ever. It reminded her of
when she had first joined the school. All those strange feelings were
returning to her, and they were starting to make her feel sick. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think by the
end of today, I'm going to come out around five pounds lighter,&quot;
She jokingly said to herself, trying to forget about the situation
she was in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Upon entering her
room, there was no one inside. Her roommate consisted of Erin and
another female student. Most of the time, their other roommate seemed
to be out, which was a good thing for Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, just to be
safe, she kept an eye on the door as she went about making contact
with Pure. She had already been caught once by Logan and had no clue
how, which started to make her do some second-guessing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All those years of
training were hammered into her so she wouldn't be caught during an
investigation, and in the end, she was caught by another student.
This made her very uncertain of her own skills, maybe she just wasn't
made, for this type of work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The black orb from
under her bed was now in her hand. And once again, she took a deep
breath, readying herself before tapping the top of the sphere. The
blue ring on the top started to pulse, fading in and out until
eventually, it turned into a solid blue colour, signalling that it
had been connected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Agent 45
connected with agent 83. Today isn't a report day. Why are you
contacting us outside of protocol? Are there any problems?&quot; the
voice from the sphere asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would like
to make a special report, would you please connect me to agent number
5?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The single
digit agents are too busy right now. You can make your report to me,
and I will pass on the message to them.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll ask you
again,&quot; Layla said firmly. <FONT FACE="Tahoma, serif">��</FONT>Please
let me speak to agent number 5. This is not a request as an agent,
but say that it's from her daughter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There seemed to be a
slight pause, where agent 45 seemed to have a conversation with
another agent for a moment before he eventually replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I will contact
her, and see what she has to say, wait a moment.&quot; Agent 45 said
in a slightly annoyed tone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla waited while
the other agent went and contacted her mother. In the Pure
organization, they had special numbers associated with each agent.
The number system could be split up into four different categories. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first group of
people were those in the hundreds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These agents of Pure
were given no specific number ranking. All they were told was that
they were above the one hundred special agents. These people would
often be new to the Pure organization and would only be used on large
scale operations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the second
group below them were the ranked agents. These agents were numbered
from 20 to 100. These were special operative agents whose numbers
were based on their position within the organization. The lower your
number was, the more power you had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The third group were
the high rankers, going from 6 to 20. They were quite different
compared to the other agents, mainly due to the fact that they were
chosen because of their power, and not their achievements for Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And then you had the
last group, the final 1 to 5. Some of these members were the original
creators of Pure, and they were also the strongest within the
organisation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Layla was first
introduced to the ranking system, she found it weird. For a group who
was so hell-bent against there being a hierarchy in society, it was
actually strange for their own group to have one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But they always said
that it was different because they all had the same goal in mind and
understood. It would only be this way for now until they achieved
their goal, and then, they would get rid of the ranking system. By
then, equipment, wealth and resources would be distributed equally. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla started to
remember the demo videos they showed her of what the world could be,
and they always seemed so peaceful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she was deep in
thought, she had lost track of time a bit, and she was startled when
she heard a familiar voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is agent
5 speaking, I hear you have some important news for me, agent 83?&quot;
the voice said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing those
words come out of her mouth, Layla was a little upset. She hadn't
spoken to her mother in a while, and the first thing she talked about
was business. She didn't ask her how she was, or how she was doing,
and didn't even say her name. But she had always been like this, and
Layla was used to it by now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla started to
explain the details of what happened. How she acted on her own
without informing Pure to protect her friends, going against Jack and
what the situation currently was. Though she did leave out a few
details here and there, especially the parts where she had informed
all of her friends who she was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far, she had only
said she told Erin, someone who she wanted to bring over to Pure,
about her real position. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Has your
position been compromised by anyone else in the school or personnel?&quot;
her mother asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I have
only informed Erin. Right now, they think she escaped on her own.
They are looking for her, and she has no ability, as well as nowhere
to go. If you can, please help her.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,&quot;
she replied. &quot;We will do our best. Anyone who has been affected
by Truedream will be accepted. We shall treat her well. However, you
have gone against our code. Although you were not caught, you took
action without asking for permission, and you even went as far as to
use our name.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Your
punishment will be decided when you come back to the base. For now,
you shall be demoted from position 83 to position 100. Update me when
you have the location Erin will be sent to. We will have someone
waiting on standby.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, and one
last thing. Layla, I am waiting for you. Soar through the ranks.
Don't be disheartened and try to get into the upper level so we can
meet more frequently. May Pure be with you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the call ended,
Layla kept her head down. A demotion was quite a big punishment on
its own as it was. It had taken Layla a long time to rise through the
ranks and just like that, she was at the bottom, barely hanging onto
the last numbered position. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When she was at the
base, she rarely got to see her mother. Her mother always told her,
as long as she was loyal to Pure and the cause. Eventually, she would
rise up the ranks and have a seat next to her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far she had been
as loyal as can be, and followed everything to the letter of the
book. But everything changed slightly when she met Quinn and the
others. She started having fun and enjoyed her time at school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sure, there were bad
people in the world, but she found out that not everyone abused their
powers. There were those like Erin who didn't even understand there
was injustice and discrimination going on. Layla felt like they just
needed to educate the world more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She started
questioning if Pure's forceful ways were really the right way to do
things, which is why she was hesitant about reporting Quinn and the
others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If there was a
chance she could leave the organization without receiving a
punishment, she might have even considered it. And now, when thinking
about it, she was about to send one of her best friends to such a
place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

have meant that Logan had successfully sent the fake video over. The
contents explained how members of Pure had already triumphantly
retrieved Peter and Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see.&quot;
Leo replied. &quot;So has the search party for them been called off?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not quite. We,
including a few other soldiers, have been called back for a meeting.
Perhaps, it was to discuss the next course of action.&quot; As Fay
finished her words, she spotted the two boys standing not too far
away from Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, she
thought that they were just two students who were just taking a walk
around the school. Withal, she quickly realised that they also halted
their steps when Leo did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other thing that
she noticed was that they weren't just any students. They were the
first year students who she had been seeing more than she would have
liked to. Wherever these two went, it seemed like trouble was simply
lurking in their shadows. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The moment that Fay
focused her attention on the two, Vorden realized the mistake that
they had just made. Usually, he was good at this type of thing and
would have carried on walking to not incur a suspension. The problem
was he and Quinn had both gotten caught up on what Fay had to say. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know
if you're aware of this Leo, but there seem to be two first year
students following closely behind you.&quot; Fay said, further
narrowing her gaze that was on Vorden and Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I may be
blind, but I do know when I'm being trailed.&quot; Leo replied. &quot;They
are here to help me move a few things from my storage room. I promise
I will go to the meeting room as soon as I'm done.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it was anyone
else, Fay would have complained, suggesting that as a sergeant, they
were neglecting their duty. If the general asked them to be present,
then they needed to be immediately. However, Leo had some leeway when
it came to the other sergeants. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was because
they were aware of the fact that they wanted him, and it wasn't the
other way around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I will let
them know that you will be a little late then.&quot; Fay said as she
gave a salute before she took her leave. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I wonder when the
two of them managed to get close to Leo?' A lingering thought
registered in her mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She made it a point
to look over their files once she had returned to her office. She
felt that something was amiss regarding the set-up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the other hand,
finally, Leo stopped in his tracks, prompting the students to do the
same. They had reached an area in the school that they had never gone
to before. It was located around the back of the teleport area, and
to access it, a special code should be inputted on a panel that
served as the lock. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Agan, Vorden was
amazed at how well Leo was able to navigate the entire place. He
couldn't help but think that it had to have something to do with his
ability. His curiosity was getting the better of him as a strange
urge to touch Leo arose in him, but the opportunity didn't arrive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they entered
the special building, they noticed that it was full of rooms that
housed an eerie ambience. They were all barricaded with metal doors
that had numbers painted on their facade. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This area is
dedicated for the soldiers' storage room. When we moved here, we were
allowed to bring our own personal belongings.&quot; Leo explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They walked for a
few seconds, eventually stopping right before the door that had the
number &quot;12&quot; painted on it. There is a security device that
made sure that the only one who had access to this room was him,
unlike the other codes utilized on the previous doors. Placing his
hand on top of the access panel, it soon allowed Leo inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the storage
unit opened, both Quinn and Vorden were amazed at what was inside.
There were weapons that were displayed on all sides of the room. In
the center was something that looked similar to a boxing ring. Only,
there was a wooden doll, similarly sized to an average adult human
being, holding a wooden sword. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The whole place
looked like any other weapons hall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are all these
yours?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, they once
belonged to me and my friends. I just inherited them.&quot; Leo said
with a melancholic tone in his voice as he continued to walk towards
the back of the storage room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys waited
at the back while Leo went to search for something. While biding for
their time, they couldn't help but look at the weapons surrounding
them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
items, Quinn was curious to see what level they were at, and to his
surprise, the first random weapon he looked at in the room was at the
advanced tier level - It was a short little dagger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went to
continue to inspect the weapons, noticing that most of them were of
high class and were classified as beast equipment. He couldn't even
imagine how much the whole thing would cost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It turned out that
Quinn wasn't the only one, who noticed that the equipment around them
were nearly all high gears, as Vorden did too. &quot;Hey, if you're
not going to use these things, do you mind if I keep it?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, Leo came
out from the back, holding a fairly large circular device - It was
almost the same size as his upper body. He placed it in front of the
two students, making a loud sound as it hit the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm afraid
that all of these weapons are cursed.&quot; Leo said. &quot;Their
users died with too much resentment and those emotions stayed in
their weapons.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Concurrently, Leo
placed his hand on his very own weapon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You didn't
have to make up some lie if you didn't want to give it to me.&quot;
Vorden cheekily replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sometimes, our
very own eyesight blinds us.&quot; Leo explained. &quot;Having no
sight has allowed me to see more things than I have ever seen before.
If only you could see the things I could see, perhaps, you would
begin to understand a little.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The words that Leo
spoke really started to interest Vorden and it was the bait he
needed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'The sight he was
referring to probably had something to do with his ability' Vorden
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh,&quot;
Vorden replied. &quot;If you're talking about your ability, is there
a way you can show me? I have the ability to copy and use other
people's abilities. All I need to do is to touch their hand.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was a little
afraid about how Leo would react. He could tell that, it might be
that Vorden was pushing it just a little too far, but surprisingly,
Leo started to laugh. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ha, ha, if you
really wish to, then go ahead.&quot; Leo said as he held out his
hand. At the same time, a strange smile appeared across his face, and
the pressure that Vorden felt before, he could sense it once more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden
explained to Leo about his abilities, Leo was doing his regular thing
checking to see if he was speaking the truth or not. It was for this
reason that Leo wasn't as cautious as usual, because he saw that
Vorden wasn't lying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From experience, Leo
knew it wasn't a good idea to have contact with someone's ability you
didn't know or trust. Certain abilities had conditions that needed to
be met before using them. This was called a cost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cost abilities were
usually stronger than regular abilities but there were only a few
that the public could obtain, most were kept secret by the originals.
Two examples of cost abilities were Vorden's where he needed to touch
a user's bare skin before being able to use their power, and Jacks
who could only absorb their power through the user's mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cost abilities were
quite rare, and some were still being discovered even today.
Sometimes families had passed down ancient scripts that their
ancestors knew nothing about but practised them out of tradition. To
only later find out that there was a cost involved to unlocking their
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many people assumed

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden looked at
Leo's hand once again, and this time was hesitating slightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Just do it.' Raten
complained. 'Do you have to be so careful about everything you do?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Raten speaking
his mind like a little devil on his shoulder, he eventually took the
plunge and shook Leo's hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A new energy was
felt flowing inside of Vorden. The cells in his body were finally
changing, it was the strongest force he had ever felt enter his body
before. Even when touching the hand of Berg, a member of a big four
family, and a level eight user, he had never felt this type of energy
before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the two of
them let go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well?&quot;
Leo asked. &quot;Do you see what I see?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden activated the
ability and his whole vision went black. He could no longer see using
his regular eyesight. Instead, the walls and floor appeared like
wireframes that were constantly moving. As if the ground and the
walls around him were alive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when he looked
at his own hand, he could see the flow of yellow energy appearing off
his own body. He turned his head and looked at Quinn who was giving
off a different colour. A dark purple hue, which burned brightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden now
understood why Leo was able to tell that Quinn was different, it was
the colours of energy. Finally though when he looked at Leo the
largest shock came to him. Leo's flame was yellow just like Vorden's.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, there was a
big difference between the two. The flow of energy-burning in Leo was
much more intense, and it seemed to be at least four times bigger
than his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'But how?' Vorden
thought. It didn't make sense to Vorden. When using his ability not
only did he copy the ability but also the number of mutant cells in
their body. Even if Leo's ability was beyond that of level eight on
the military scale, Vorden should have still been able to copy it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when looking at
his own aura and looking at Leo's there was a big difference and he
couldn't understand why. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, Vorden started
to notice something else. The sword around Leo's waist was also
burning a bright red colour, and the energy coming off it was nearly
as strong as that of Leo himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden was
looking at Leo, he started to point towards the weapons on the wall.
As he turned his head he noticed that all the weapons that were hung
up, they too were burning with a bright red colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is this normal
for beast weapons?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems like
you really can see, what I can see.&quot; A regular beast weapon does
not shine in colour. As I said before these are different.&quot; Leo
explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And what about
you?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;Why are you…&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On planet Lintarnia,
along a clear blue river a medium-sized shelter could be seen. It was
a tier four shelter with a population of around 20,000 people. The
shelter wasn't owned by the military or the big four, but instead it
was owned by a secret benefactor who would rent it out, and he would
hire travellers or traveller factions to guard the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was unusual for
a shelter, because usually they would publicly declare who they were
protected by to avoid any confrontation with other groups, but not
this one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shelter was
surrounded by hilltops and long green fields, and it seemed like the
area was completely devoid of beasts. Standing by one of the portal
entrances was a young man who was tapping his foot on the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he was waiting he
watched the children and families happily play with each other on the
street, while others were happily swimming in the river. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So peaceful.&quot;
The young man said. &quot;They can live their lives out here all
happy, but they're unaware of what is happening back on earth, or on
the other planets. Everyone deserves a nice place like this, not only
you guys.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A strange sound was
heard by his side and when he turned his head, he could see the space
next to him becoming distorted. Warping in and out, suddenly, a
bright white circular portal appeared, and dropping out of it came a
snow white skinned woman with blond hair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She braced herself
gently as she landed on the floor but for a few moments stayed

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And has its
wings torn down and falls to the ground,&quot; Erin replied. Before
leaving, Layla had informed her, if someone was to approach her they
would speak a certain phrase. This was a code so agents could tell
who was who between each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like
you're the right one, follow me.&quot; He said, while waving at her
to follow. She trailed after the young man for a while as they walked
through the shelter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking around
she noticed how calm and peaceful the place looked. It was different
to other shelters, but it also reminded her of the place she used to
live, the shelter her family used to protect before the Dalki
attacked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Following the young
man, he was eventually leading them both out of the shelter. Before
stepping out Erin turned and took one last look at the peaceful
place. A thought crossed her mind that maybe she could just run away,
and stay here. It might be a better option than going to Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But looking at the
peaceful town, images of houses that were on fire, and of destroyed
buildings appeared in her head. She suddenly remembered why she
wanted to get stronger in the first place. For something like that to
never happen in her presence ever again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at the
boy she noticed that he seemed to be wearing quite a decent level of
beast gear. On his back was a single long sword, the hilt was black
and covered in scales, but the guard was as wide as his shoulders.
From looking at it she could tell holding the thing would be heavy,
and a regular human wouldn't be able to wield such a large sword. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He also wore metal
plated armour that seemed to mix in beast parts here and there. Such
as blue fins near the shoulder pads, and scaled parts over the shin
protector on his legs. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, they had
reached the top of the hill. From the top looking down, they were
still able to see the river flowing through the valley, and the
shelter just from the other side. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This should be
far enough.&quot; the young man said standing near the edge of the
clifftop. The man started to walk around as if he was looking for
something on the floor until eventually a ping sound was heard. &quot;Here
it is.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man started to
dig down at the spot with his bare hands, and although he was tearing
huge chunks of the ground away, he made it look like he was just
shifting a little sand away, it looked very impressive. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin looked at the
floor where the man was digging and then looked at his hands which
were covered with dirt. At least he was wearing a pair of gloves, but
the only thing she managed to bring with her was her sword that
always stayed around her waist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unwillingly, she
took a step forward, although she didn't want to get dirt on her
hands she thought it would be best if she made a good impression with
the people she would be staying with, maybe even for a couple of
years. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as she moved
forward, a loud screeching sound could be heard in the air. At first,
it looked like a small black dot in the sky, but it started to get
bigger and eventually Erin had a clear view of what it was. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Watch out!&quot;

town was, she had forgotten about the fact that this still wasn't
earth. Dangerous beasts lived on these planets. </FONT></FONT>

surrounding the energy inside, it meant the higher the tier of
crystal. Right now what Erin held in her hands was a crystal with its
first outer shell entirely clear. </FONT></FONT>

two, it seemed like things were starting to calm down. Not just for
the soldiers in the base but also for Quinn and his group. It seemed
the video had worked quite well, and it looked like they had nearly
called off the search entirely. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The base was now
just treating it as a secondary objective now rather than a full-on

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was only one
problem left to solve right now and that was Peter. The group had
decided they would continue to hide Peter inside Logan's room. It
wasn't the right time to reveal him, because the tension was still a

cause for extra scrutiny, which they didn't want. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Despite their

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan asked Peter to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually with all

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, a pair of

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan had dropped a

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What was also
strange to see, was that right now, Logan had set the game to allow
his body to react like it would do in real life without the game
helping him and adding realistic fatigue, the most amazing part of it
was that Peter never seemed to get tired at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was able to fight
just as well now after all those tests, as he did from the start of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the
simulation had ended and Peter came out of the pod. After gathering
all of Peter's stats, Logan had come to the conclusion that Peter
would make a great spy or assassin. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When using the
weapons he performed best with the short duel blades. Also he never
tired, and could run at great speeds. Furthermore, he also had a

wanted. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason the two
boys had decided to pay Logan a visit right after their classes
wasn't just to check up on Peter. A while ago Fex had said that he
would teach Quinn how to use the vampire style of martial arts that
focused on using their hands and fists as weapons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the time, Quinn
didn't trust Fex too much. So he came up with the idea of allowing
Logan to record Fex's ability, and upload it to the games private
server. This way Fex would not be able to control Quinn's body and
make him attack his friends, but he could use the ability inside the
game to teach Quinn how to fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, the
two of them had gotten a little closer, and Quinn actually felt that
even if they were to do this outside of the game, Fex would bring no
harm to his friends. There were multiple opportunities when Fex could
have done this, but he always chose not to and had helped them out
greatly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, Quinn was
still a little bit cautious, for he didn't even know Fex reason for
being at the school. Another reason was also that if they were to
practise in the game it would be away from the preying eyes of
others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing what
Quinn wanted to do, a strange energy filled Logan's eyes once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I suppose I
still have some energy left in me.&quot; Logan said as he quickly
hopped onto his computer. &quot;Go on then Quinn, you've done this
before, show him what to do.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like Quinn had
done before, Fex was placed into the fairly large glass tube, he was
then told to use his ability in different ways while the tube and
computer would record how his ability worked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Watching from the
outside, Quinn felt like it was strange how the tube and computer
were able to so accurately replicate the abilities in the game. The
other thing that impressed him was the fact Logan wasn't typing
anything into his computer at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He just had his hand
pressed up against it, while this was happening thousands of lines of
code where being written. Quinn had seen Logan's ability a few times
now and had seen it used in quite versatile ways, so he had come to a
conclusion of what it might be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ability to
communicate with machines, or more precisely give life to machines.
When Quinn was last in his room and used the inspect skill there were
a couple of items, that Quinn thought he should have been able to
use, but when he picked them up there was no reaction, nothing at
all, and it seemed like the machine was broken. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But without saying
anything Logan would touch the machine and it would light up and work
once again. If his ability was able to give life to the gadgets that
he created it was the perfect ability for Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With anyone else it
would be pretty useless, apart from bypassing doors and such. But for
Logan it allowed him to use his ability in so many different ways,
just like he was doing now with the games, and with the little
spiders, they saw being used multiple times. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And we are
done.&quot; Logan said as he opened his eyes and let go of the
computer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How will we
play?&quot; Quinn axed. &quot;There's only one VR machine.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I actually
thought of that beforehand,&quot; Logan said as he threw into the air
two very small square looking nano sticks. Both Quinn and Fex caught
them with ease by swiping their hands in the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Usually if you
try putting anything into the VR capsules it will just reject them
for security reasons, but those have been blessed by me.&quot; Logan
explained. &quot;Just head to the back and pop them in, then when you
log into the VR capsule it will give you the option of which server
to connect to. I've put both the shadow and string ability into the
private server for you to use. Now get out of here, and go play your
little game.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving the
room, Quinn gave a few drops of blood to Peter and gave the same
command as before. Although Logan felt like there was no reason for
the two of them to get into a fight, but he didn't know if Peter's
violent nature was being suppressed by Quinn's blood or not. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the two
boys left the room, Logan almost collapsed on his bed. He didn't
sleep much but every so often he would be burnt out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter looked at
Logan in the room, before looking at the VR capsule again. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you mind if
I use the VR capsule?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Logan was
already asleep. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whatever, it's
just a game.&quot; Peter said as he climbed into the machine. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Fex were
now in the game's white lobby room together. They had done as Logan
instructed. And just like he said when they went to log into the
game, it gave them the option to connect to the normal servers, or
the private server Logan had created. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now they were
in the private server. Fex was currently testing out his string
ability and he was amazed at how life like it felt. There were a few
things that he wasn't able to do with the strings that he could do on
the outside, but that was mainly when he tried combining some of his
vampire skills with his abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After testing out
his strings for a while he was finally ready. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, so the
idea is, I will control your body using the strings. Now what you
need to do is focus on the feeling of each movement. Every sequence
of moves starts off somewhere and ends somewhere. You need to put
these things together like building blocks. Rather than me showing it
to you, this is the best way I can teach you, because your body
actually experiences it along with your muscles.&quot; Fex explained.
&quot;So are you ready?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was ready this
time, within the game, there was no chance for him to be hurt in real
life. He stood with his back facing towards Fex and had his arms and
legs spread out to make it easier for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like he did
with Erin, Fex walked up to Quinn and inserted twelve different
pieces of string into twelve different parts of his body. Unlike the
real world though, there was no pain involved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex did a few simple
tests first moving his body around. It felt unnatural to Quinn as he
wanted to fight it, and he actually had the strength to resist it a
little. Unlike Erin who was limited by her regular human strength, it
was easy for Fex to force her to do what he wanted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Calm down will
you!&quot; Fex complained. &quot;For this to work, you need to be in
a sleep like state. That way I can use your body how I like. You just
need to pay attention with your mind.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn closed his
eyes and tried relaxing his body, it took a while for him to allow
his whole body to go limp as he was afraid he would fall over if he
did, but suddenly when he did, he felt a jolt in his legs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't fall over
but instead, Fex had taken control of his legs. After getting past
the strange feeling the rest was now easy for Fex. He went ahead and
did the same set of punches he did every day while he was training at
school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, there was
a lot more to martial arts then just learning how to do the moves. It
was important to know when to use them, what moves countered what and
so on. But at least it would allow Quinn to progress quicker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn concentrated
hard as Fex demonstrated the moves using his body. As his arms flew
out from different angles, they were fast and stiff. At the same
time, his body was always in a position where he could see an
oncoming attack, while being able to block using his shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the set of
punches were demonstrated to Quinn, Fex disconnected the strings and
allowed him to practice them. With the feeling fresh in his mind
Quinn didn't want to waste any time and started to perform them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn tried to
combine the feeling of the punches, together with his muscle memory
from being controlled by Fex, and it seemed to be working out well
for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex watched Quinn
carefully as each move was performed nearly perfectly to how they
were shown. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like we
have a fast learner.&quot; Fex said. Although the string method was
able to help someone progress faster it couldn't help them
completely. In the end, it was down to the person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Erin, she too
had tried performing the moves nearly instantly but not once was she
successful, but here, it seemed like something had connected for
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Quinn, am I just

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn didn't want

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The usual sound had
appeared which indicated that Quinn was able to unlock something from
the system. As he practised the moves, he felt something strange
happening. it was as if his body was still being guided by the
strings, but it clear it wasn't. The memory was so fresh in his head
his body was moving on its own and after the last movement, the
message had appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Basic arts?' Quinn
read. 'Does this means there are stronger vampire martial arts out
there? Maybe Fex only taught me the basics on purpose, or maybe he
only knows the basics?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second message
was what interested Quinn more. The last times he had watched the
tutorial videos they had helped him out greatly. Teaching him the
flash step and the Hammer strike. The second tutorial video taught
him how to combine moves. This time, the tutorial was unlocked when
Quinn had learned the vampire martial arts so perhaps there was a
tutorial skill related to it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He quickly glanced
over at Fex, just in case, Quinn chose not to watch the videos right
now. Quinn was playing the complete beginner act when it came to
vampire arts. If he was to demonstrate a skill that hadn't been
taught then it would only raise suspicion. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think I got
the basics down,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Is there anything else
besides this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex looked at Quinn
again, still mesmerized by how quickly he had learnt the fighting
style. This was something he did day in and out as a child and
amongst others, and even then he was considered a genius. But if he
was a genius then what did that make Quinn who had learnt it in a few
hours. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The thought came
into Fex's head that maybe Quinn had already known the arts and was
lying for some reason, but when thinking back to their first fight it
seemed impossible. He would have to be a first class actor to fake
punches that bad, and then do the same again when fighting against
the teacher Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes,&quot; Fex
replied. &quot;These are only the basics, I can perform at a level
above what I showed you obviously, but I honestly wouldn't be good
enough to teach you it. If you want to learn some more you're better
off getting a real teacher to show you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Part of what Fex had
just said was a lie. It was true he most likely couldn't teach Quinn.
He tried that once before and his explanations weren't the best.
Still, whatever Fex could do with his own body he could do using
someone as a puppet. Even slightly better. There was a small fear
inside Fex that if carried on teaching Quinn and saw the same thing
happen with the more advanced vampire martial arts. He wouldn't know
how to react. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the two of
them were busy practising inside the private server, they were
unaware of what was happening elsewhere in the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So is it
another hacker, this game has been going downhill these days.&quot;
Someone watching the match had said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But that's his
fifteenth win in a row. Surly the admins would have found out about
him by now?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think he

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, then how
do you explain the extra strength or the crazy speed he has, it
doesn't look like he's wearing any beast gear to me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few people up in
the crowd were currently watching a particular student play the VR
game. Each of them had lost the matches but found their fights a
little strange so they opted to watch the next few games. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as they watched

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A new game had
started and once again the student they had their eye on was going up
against a level three telekinesis user. The telekinesis user had
several black balls attached around his chest while his opponent had
no weapons at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing on the
opposite side was Peter. He didn't look like his usual self as he was
slightly disguised by the avatar. Although he selected a pretty basic
default design that just had a randomly generated face with a few
scraps of clothing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fight had begun
and Peter rushed in forward. At the same time, the telekinesis user
threw out the metallic balls using his ability to speed them up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, however, was
fast and was able to dodge most of the incoming attacks and the few
that he couldn't, he knocked away with his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the
opponent was strong and there were too many metallic balls floating
in the air for Peter to dodge, and Peter wasn't exactly the most
skilful person when it came to fighting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, one of
the metallic balls came at great speed and managed to hit Peter in
the centre of his shin, smashing it and breaking it in half, causing
him to fall onto the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others watching
this could feel the pain just from watching Peter. Although the game
only replicated a small amount of pain back to the user they could
imagine it would still hurt a lot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Telekinesis user
calmly walked over to Peter thinking it was all over. He had taken
out one of his opponent's legs, and without being able to move it
would usually mean the end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the others
watching from the stand knew it wasn't the end for Peter. They had
all thought the same thing when fighting against Peter. Suddenly,
after a few moments, Peter was able to stand up again, as if the
attack had never hit his leg in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately after he
ran towards his opponent. He was caught off guard and in a panic
tried to fire all the metallic balls right at Peter. But his speed
was impressive. Peter dodged the balls and even though they were now
chasing him, he was far faster than the balls. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, when he
was close enough, Peter pounced on top of his opponent and widely
swung his fists towards his head. There was no class and no style
with Peter attacks, it was like one of a wild animal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of the
opponent's Peter had gone against had witnessed his impressive
regenerative abilities. It was that of a high level ability user.
Still, some people were suspicious for Peter seemed to also have
impressive strength and speed on top of his healing powers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the game had
ended just outside the VR pod, Logan was finally waking up from his
nap. As he slowly opened his eyes and looked around the room he
noticed that Peter wasn't there. Upon closer inspection of the room,
he noticed that the VR pod indicator light was on, showing that
someone was currently using the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter!&quot;
Logan said as he rushed over to the computer and immediately logged
in. It was as he thought, Peter had not logged into the private
server to play, but instead had logged into the military servers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly, Logan
brought up a log of Peter's past games hoping he hadn't done anything
to stand out. After watching the highlights of Peter's last game a
slight smile appeared on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He too was currently
witnessing the amazing regenerative abilities that he possessed. When
joining the games Peter hadn't selected any abilities. Which meant
the VR pod was able to record how Peter's body would be able to react
to such things in real life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like with
Quinn. Because his body was able to perform the vampire abilities the
game allowed him to do it. Rather than it being a part of his
ability. Right now, the exact same thing had happened to Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;These vampires
are more interesting than I thought,&quot; Logan said, still there
was now another problem on Logan's hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had already
received a few emails from admins, asking to look into the user ID of
ZombieP. Making sure it wasn't a hacked player. As there had already
been a few complaints made online. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess your
fame online will be a short one Peter. The world cannot learn of you
just yet.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, Logan
forcefully disconnected, Peter from the online world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it was a
little too late as some of the videos of Peter's amazing regenerative
powers had already been spread online. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was an event that
required all of the eight military bases to enter - It was basically
a competition among the bases. The events varied from certain
activities and games to straight out fighting. The military bases
would compete to see who had raised the best and strongest students.
Moreover, the leaders and generals would often be rewarded greatly

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was very rare for
first years to compete in some of the minor events, as most of the
slots for each activity would usually be taken up by a second year

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An example of this
would be the hack-the-vault challenge. In this tournament, the team
would have to make their way through numerous security devices and

of particular skills. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them were
in the room - Sam was sitting down while poring over a level 6
ability book that was placed on the floor. Meanwhile, Nate was
standing as he observed his companion. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam had his eyes
closed for a while now, meditating. All the while energy was flowing
inside his body, he was trying the techniques that were written down
on the book. The power began to rise from the pit of his stomach, but
soon after, he would feel a great pain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of a sudden, a

what he was doing. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam looked at his
friend's wrist watch that was now displaying the number 7. Nate had
grown so much stronger and Sam was always behind him, so he wanted to
catch up. Sam had done well in increasing his ability from level 4 to

book. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nevertheless, the
problem that he had right now was one that tortured many. Hence, he
had reached his limit not long after. Just because one had a high

learn it. Usually, humans have varying anatomy, mainly on the aspect
that each and everyone of their bodies produces different amounts of
MC cells. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam knew what this

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
too much. There are plenty of people out there who are strong even
without the use of abilities. Look at that Pure group for example.&quot;
Nate said with a cheery tone in his voice, wanting to ease the

gear that suits your ability. Also, we can always work on your

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate's face had gone
bright red at this point as he started to remember the small banter
that he and Silver had. &quot;That teacher is bonkers. She already
made fun of my head, but she refuses to call me by my name and calls
me blockhead all the time. I even decided to shave the corners of my
beautiful hair because of her.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I also heard
about how one of the other teachers confessed to her. Apparently, the
next day, he came in to school with a black eye,&quot; Sam replied as
he looked at his friend's new haircut. &quot;I always wondered why
you purposely matched up your hair with your face's jawline. I
actually think this rounded look is a lot better for you,&quot; Sam
replied. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, inside
the school's IT room, Silver was currently standing above one of the
school's staff members. The reflection from the screen was showing
that his eyes had a slight red tint to them, meaning that he was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It appeared like
everyone was busy, dead set on doing their own thing. Because of
this, Vorden was finding the situation a little boring. Before, he
would often spend his spare time teaching Peter on how to use the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it wasn't
something like that, then Vorden would be racking up his head, trying
to figure out how to get out of a tough situation. It was as if he

there were only two people who he could talk to. Although, they
seemed to be always a bad influence on him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Guys, will you
all just calm down!&quot; Vorden hollered, annoyed of his companions'
complaints. &quot;Sil, I know you're worried, but if Layla has done
something, I think Pure or her would have done something by now. Yet,
no harm has come to him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With these words,
Sill's gradually slowed down the motion he had been doing. This was a
sign that Sil was starting to calm down a little. Now, Vorden needed
to deal with another person. The more riled up Raten got, it would
affect Sil to a similar level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden's aim was

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was always
this fear with Vorden -- Although he wanted the best for Sil, if Sil

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about the

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine.&quot;
Vorden replied, giving in to the idea. He knew firsthand that if he
didn't do something, Raten would continue down this path and
eventually, he would make Sil worry. &quot;Then, I will go talk to
Layla.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few moments
passed, Vorden could be seen walking around the school aimlessly,
searching for all the popular spots where the other students would
usually hang out at. Regrettably for him, as he arrived at each area,
he did not find any trace of Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Who does Layla even
hang around with?' Vorden contemplated on the matter. As he
reminisced, he thought of the two students who were the sole people
that he had seen Layla talk to - They were Quinn and Erin. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Presently, with Erin
gone and Quinn consistently spending his time in the VR pod, it meant
that Layla would be most likely in her room. Thus, Vorden proceeded
to go to the dorms to try and meet Layla. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a few minutes,
he landed at his destination. With a knock on the door, a female
student answered it. That was the first time that Vorden had ever
seen her. The most prominent feature of the lady was her short black
hair, with a fringe that cascaded her face, nearly covering the
entirety of her right eye. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her name was Cia and
she was the third person who was occupying Erin and Layla's room. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you

seemingly bothered by Vorden's appearance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is Layla
there?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you her
boyfriend?&quot; Cia said as she scanned Vorden's body from head to
toe. &quot;I'm guessing you two had an argument or something, judging
how she's been since yesterday. Or maybe, it was the fact that she
found out her best friends were terrorists, but she's not here.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the
explanation the school had given - That eight students had been found
with connections to the group known as Pure and were taken to the
dungeon as a form of punishment. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;She's not a
terrorist,&quot; Vorden mumbled. He didn't know why, yet hearing
Erin's name trashed like that by a stranger, who didn't know the
truth of the whole matter, really annoyed him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whatever man.
Look, if you want to find layla,, she's usually by the back of the
building, sitting on the bench just underneath the large tree. Erin
and her would often go there together.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that piece of
information, Vorden left without saying another word. Most commonly
than not, he would be a bit more polite. However, something about Cia
just rubbed him the wrong way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh pretty
boy!&quot; Cia shouted. &quot;If you and Layla aren't an item, then
feel free to pop a visit in my room anytime.&quot; She said, winking
at him as she closed the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, that's my

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shut up.&quot;
Vorden replied as he went off to the location that Cia had informed
him about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sun had already
set and the darkness encompassed the sky. Although it still wasn't
very late, usually, the sun would set after seven in the evening.
While walking to the location though, Vorden felt like it would be
strange to be seen anywhere in the area. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It might be fine in
the middle of the day, but at night was plainly bizarre. As he turned
the corner, he did indeed see someone sitting alone on a bench right
underneath a tree. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden moved in
closer and closer. Eventually, he reached the spot in front of her.
It wasn't until the last moment that Layla lifted her head up. Her
eyes were bloodshot and her face was a little swollen. There were

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, what
do you want?&quot; Layla asked in a rude tone. She had just lost her
best friend, and the last person she wanted to see was lingering
before her eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we
need to talk about whether or not I can trust you?&quot; Vorden
asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This again.&quot;
Layla moned. &quot;Here, why should I care if you even trust me or
not? Let's put it straight, Vorden. Me and you are not friends and we
probably never will be. Especially since you keep acting like this
all the time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, Layla, I
need to know. I thought it was fine, but now that I know you're a
part of Pure…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what?&quot;
Layla interrupted Vorden. &quot;I was in Pure this whole time before
everything started. The only difference now is that you guys know
about it. That hasn't changed who I am, and let me ask you. Aren't
you going around accusing me all the time? But what about you? Why do
you care so much about Quinn?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, Layla
had stood up from the bench and was starting to inch closer towards
Vorden. Accordingly, he continued to step back every time she took a
step forward. Withal, it wasn't because he was scared of her, but
because of the voices in his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If she takes
one more step closer to us Vorden and you don't do anything about it,
I swear...&quot; Raten said, his tone a tad threatening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shut up!&quot;
Vorden shouted as he grabbed his head. &quot;Layla, I need to trust
you. If I can't trust you, then I'm afraid of what will happen to
you.&quot; When Vorden spoke of these words, he wasn't saying them in
his usual tone of voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla picked up on
this, since he had said it sincerely and it made Layla frightened a
little. She knew something was up with Vorden, but wasn't sure just
what. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Perhaps, it was a
drawback of his powerful ability?' She thought 'But just what was
happening to Vorden? And why did he give so much attachment to Quinn?

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then tell me,
Vorden, what can I do to prove I'm on your side?&quot; She asked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fortunately, Vorden
had prepared an answer for this question. Hence, as he walked over to
her, it was the only thing he could think of. &quot;Let Quinn turn
you into a vampire. That way, I know that you're on his side.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla's anger
bubbled within her at such a question. She wanted to shout and ask
the same question to him! Why couldn't he do it as well? He could get
turned as well. And yet despite wanting to ask such a question on why
he couldn't do the same… she already knew the answer. It was the
loss of the ability of Vorden. He was already strong on his own and
proved himself a good asset to the team. His skills were versatile
and had helped them out several times because of that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While for her it
didn't mean much. Her powers were quite weak only being a level 2. In
fact, she had even bought a level three ability book before hoping to
improve her powers but there was no such luck. She was one of the
unfortunate souls that even with money weren't able to increase the
strength of her ability. She was stuck at level two this was her
bottleneck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I want to
Vorden, but it's too risky right now.&quot; She replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, when Layla
had met Quinn and had experienced what happened to her, she really
did want him to turn her. Growing up the only form of entertainment
she had was books. It was her escape from her time at the Pure base. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Day in and out, they
would constantly show videos, have classes and training related to
their goal. Then when she could finally relax she took her time
reading fantasy stories of the old. Often in the books, it would talk
of a vampire sweeping a girl away from all her problems and taking
them to a new world, away from everything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After meeting Quinn
this was what had attracted her, but at the same time she couldn't
forget about the reality of why she was at the base in the first
place. Her mind kept straying away and reminding her she needed to
stick to the cause. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So she had planned
to inform Pure of her findings, a way to make their members stronger
without using abilities. However, as she grew closer to Quinn she was
afraid what would happen to him if she was to reveal to Pure what he
was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was always the
chance that Pure wouldn't be okay with it. Sometimes the
organisation's actions even confused her with how they worked and
what they deemed okay. In a way, beast weapons that they used were
just like abilities, with those more powerful than others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Did Pure distribute
them equally to their followers? Yet, they deemed this as okay. Then
when she saw what happened with Peter, second thoughts were running
through her head. IF Layla were to do those things then she didn't
know how she would face her family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She wasn't very
close with them but her mother was all she knew and all she had right
now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I go off
the radar, stop reporting to Pure and choose to be by Quinn's side,
they could run an investigation. They might think at first what
happened to me was the same as everyone else, but they would quickly
find out I was still okay. They would then look into me send
higher-ups and then Quinn would be in even more trouble.&quot; Layla
explained. &quot;When the time is right, I promise I will be by
Quinn's side.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although she had
said this she still wasn't sure herself. When it came between
choosing Pure over Quinn right now she would still choose Pure where
her family was and now Erin as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing her
explanation it seemed Layla had made a lot of sense. She could be
lying about the whole thing but Vorden didn't really know how Pure
worked. Right now, everything was okay so he wouldn't want to stir
the pot anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's not just
about Pure,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;You're too weak to help and
it seems like you will cause more problems for us in the future than
help. At least you might be of some use to us if you're turned.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These last words
that Vorden had spoken were the biggest hit to Layla. She knew this,
her whole life she felt like this even within the Pure organisation.
She wasn't any help to her mother, she wasn't any help to her friends
and she couldn't even help that much when her friend needed her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, can I
ask?!&quot; She shouted and focused her thoughts elsewhere, &quot;How
did you know I was here?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This area she was in
right now was a place where she and Erin would often just hang out
with the two of them. There were never many students here so she was
surprised Vorden was able to find her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Your roommate
told me!&quot; Vorden shouted back as he walked away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Roommate, Cia?
How would she know? I'm surprised she actually paid attention to me
and Erin. She was always just off doing her own thing. Maybe that
girl is a sweeter person than she looks.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day had
arrived, and it had now been a couple of days since the whole event
with Truedream was over and done with. The school no longer searched
for the missing students, after doing a sweep of the school, it
looked like none of the students had seen Peter or Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, they
deemed that the video that had been sent must have been true and they
were too late. Things were starting to get back to normal. With this,
Logan had made preparations for today was the day that the student
known as Pio Blank would return. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the help of
Leo, they were able to gain access to the portal room once again. The
security surrounding the place wasn't as on high alert now and being
a sergeant Leo had privileges to use the room as he wished. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sometimes the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo was able to
sneak Peter into the room and with him, several of Logan's mechanical
little spiders. After that, Leo left the room and it was all down to
Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything had been
prepared beforehand. The wristwatch had been altered to indicate the
pulse of a living person along with the level 4 ability and Logan had
also made a few adjustments in the other rooms, that he still hadn't
informed the others about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Logan's ability
and the use of his spiders, he didn't personally have to be anywhere
to make adjustments. Logan was able to freely control the metallic
spiders however he wished. Using his computer he was also able to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>IF the spiders were
ever spotted, they had a certain pattern on them that made them just

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It didn't take long
for the two guards by the door to enter the portal room and find Pio

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, when have
I ever messed up?&quot; Logan complained. &quot;It's pretty obvious
that as soon as they find a student who has been missing for a while,
and comes back in tattered clothes from a planet that had suffered a
Dalki attack, the first thing they would do is take him to the
medical facility.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was something the
others hadn't thought about. They had all been to busy and focused
with their own problems and kinda thought this would be it. All they
could do right now was believe in Logan's words and trust that he was
able to figure out a good plan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they took Peter
to the medical facility, Hayley went ahead and ran a general check on
Peter's condition. There wasn't much she needed to do as technology
had come quite a way and she noticed he didn't have any physical
wounds on his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This meant there was
no need for her to personally use her ability to heal anything on the
outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She hooked Peter up
to a large tube-like machine, while also placing several little of
what appeared to be white stickers all over his body. The machine
would show his internals and display his insides, as well as see if
there was something wrong with any of his organs, including his
heart. It further looked into the details of his blood pressure and
all sorts of vitals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And, everything
could be done with the single use of the machine. This was were
Logan's ability had come to its advantage. Beforehand, before this
all happened, Logan was able to fake a sickness and enter the medical
facility. During this time, he had touched each and every machine
available there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While doing so, he
had taken control of the machines making them feel alive. He could
now give them commands and they would follow them whenever he wanted
to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others sat their
nervously, as Hayley would continue to jot down information on her
little tablet every now and then. she would look on the screen and
then go back to her tablet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
you're in perfect condition,&quot; Hayley said as Peter lifted
himself out of the machine. &quot;Now I just need to ask you a few
questions.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, the
others listening in on everything were a little worried. But as she
asked him questions, Peter had answered everything perfectly. Hearing
this, Logan was nodding his head proudly, but the others weren't too
sure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was,
Peter had answered them all too perfectly. Answering almost
immediately and in a robot-like voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley continued
with her questions while a soldier stood by her side, noting down
everything. She had even asked about what had happened to him before
this point. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan had come up
with a backstory that was plausible according to the situation. It
detailed about when the Dalki had attacked their group, he had run
away and escaped. The only problem was that all his equipment had
been left behind and he had no clue where he was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He travelled through
the desert for numerous days, managing to feed himself using the
survival skills the school had taught him, eventually reaching a
shelter. The problem was that it was the wrong shelter. The shelter
only had teleporters that linked to other planets and none back to
earth or the military base, but he found out the shelter he had come
from wasn't too far. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He stayed until he
regained his strength and purchased a map leading him to the original
shelter and eventually returned back to the military base. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the questioning
was over. Hayley left Peter to be with a soldier guarding him as he
rested while she went off to give a report to Nathan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, how is the
boy?&quot; Nathan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thankfully, he
seems to be in perfect condition health-wise but…&quot; Hayley
hesitated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But what?&quot;
Nathan replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems like
his mind isn't all there. Sometimes, his response was quite rigid and
there seemed to be a lack of emotion. When checking Pio before, he
didn't have any of these signs. Although this could be due to the
trauma of being attacked by the Dalki; perhaps, he will come around
in the future.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's great
news!&quot; Nathan said. &quot;As long as the student is fine, it
will be okay. We can inform his parents about the good news for now.
They don't need to know about the rest until later. There is no use
worrying them over nothing if he is to return to normal soon. Have
him rejoin classes tomorrow.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But sir!&quot;
Hayley complained, &quot;Don't you think it's too soon to send him
out again? He has only just come back.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You might be
right about that; inform the student and let him decide. If he wishes
to go then, let him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you wish,
sir,&quot; Hayley said before returning. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Hayley left the
room, Nathan went to pick up the files on his desk as he read through
them one by one, he felt like pulling his hair out. he had a
stressful few days coming up. His way of thinking would often clash
with the military's current way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But this time he
thought it was too much. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;An orange
portal outing, just what are they thinking?&quot; Nathan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like
Peter's disguise had worked and they had bought Logan's plan. Quinn
didn't quite know how he did it but, he knew it was something only he
good could do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the tension now
gone, it really did seem like their group finally had no more
problems to deal with. There was still the matter with Duke, but now
with Peter gone, there was no direction. They would just have to wait
for him to make his next move against Vorden and to slip up
somewhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was late that
night and the others had left the room to go to sleep. Just before
they left the room, Fex had spotted something on Logan's workbench.
It was the square-shaped portable teleporter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the others
were busy saying their goodbyes and having a friendly chat with each
other, Fex decided to move closer to have a look. The workbench
wasn't your usual type of workbench. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were several
tools designed there just for Logan's use. There were even several
computer screens just above the workbench. Right now, it looked like
he had the square teleport device hooked up via some cables leading
upward to the computer screen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the screen above
was a random list of numbers, spanning long rows and rows of
different sequence of numbers. The machine was going through
different sequences at an alarming rate and each time, the number
would blink red and go onto the next sequence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'He can't be trying
to crack the thing, can he? I thought these things were meant to be
unbreakable.&quot; But Fex wasn't so naive. Perhaps the Vampires
thought the devices were pretty secure but after witnessing what
Logan was able to do time and time again, he thought maybe there was
the chance Logan would be able to crack the code. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This is bad.' Fex
thought. The square portable teleporters were different from the
round ones the earthlings used. They were a lot more advanced. The
circular teleporters were set to go to one destination only. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the square
ones worked more like a teleport station. An access code needed to be
put in and depending on which access code was used, it would teleport
you to the correct station. This was how Fex was able to arrive on
earth, through a similar type of teleporter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was
there being two types of square teleporters, with each slightly
different in design. On the top where the code was to be inputted, it
could either be green or red. Green meant it was able to be used to
travel to any teleport station, this included the ones on other
planets, not just earth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The one inside of
Logan's room had a red panel on top. Similar to the circle portals,
they had one destination and one destination only, it was back to the
place where Fex had come form. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had realised this
before but thought nothing much of it because, without the access
code, Logan would never be able to use the teleporter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But looking at the
screen, Fex didn't know when, but soon, he would have access to the
teleporter. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then decided to
think carefully about the words Fex had said. The device on his

Richard Eno. Quinn knew of this fact only thanks to the systems

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By home, there could
only be one place Fex was talking about. It was where the vampires
came from. Still unsure whether or not that was somewhere on earth or
another planet. But most likely from the hints given out so far, it
seems like at somewhere along the way, between when the systems
creator was a vampire and the vampires now, they had moved from the
earth and relocated to another planet. or at least a place hidden
from the human eye. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He understood that
if Logan was to figure it out, he needed to stop him. The only thing
Quinn didn't understand was why Fex seemed so concerned. If Logan was
to travel through the portal, why would he get in trouble? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It started to make
Quinn think of his first meeting with Fex. He mentioned something
along of the lines that he wasn't meant to be here. Is that the
reason why Fex hadn't acted against Quinn? If he was to be found out
then, he would be in trouble as well. And, based on what he said just
now, he had basically confirmed it. </FONT></FONT>

once again. It was a little bit of a surprise but, they assumed it
either had something to do with the next portal outing that was to be
held this weekend or the Inter military base event in a couple of
weeks. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden lined up
next to Quinn, the two of them looked around the room and eventulley
spotted Peter. Peter had been asked whether he wanted a break before
joining the school again, and they even asked him if he wanted to
take part in the next outing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had expected
him to say no, but to their surprise, Peter had insisted to be taken
on board, claiming that he wanted to get more experience as soon as
possible in order to prevent such a thing happening to him again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The real reason
though, was because Quinn had asked him to. It was important for
Quinn to keep Peter as close as possible to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden was
looking around the room, his eyes had managed to catch the female
student Cia. She was standing right by Layla, which was expected
since the two of them were roommates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden started
thinking back at the girl's strange words and just then, the two of
their eyes met. Cia noticed this and blew over a kiss towards Vorden.
Seeing this, Vorden quickly turned away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is wrong
with that girl, no class at all. Nothing like Erin.&quot; Vorden
quietly complained. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You prefer

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Onto the stage
walked Nathan. It was the first time many of the first-year students
had seen him. Usually, a general would hardly ever talk to the
students unless it was something important which made the students
fidget and slightly worry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, I'm not
one for speeches; so, let's get to the point,&quot; Nathan said. &quot;The
portal outing on the weekend; I'm here to tell you all it won't be
like usual. This year, the military has decided to expand their
operation and get more aggressive in planetary explorations.&quot;
Nathan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what does
that mean for you guys? Well, instead of the normal Green portal, you
guys get to jump ahead and explore an Orange portal instead.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing the news,
the students suddenly broke into gossip. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;An Orange

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why would they
do this to us, especially after the Dalki attack?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Silence!&quot;
Nathan shouted as he slammed his fist down onto the podium. Nathan
rarely got angry but he knew he had to calm down the crowd before it
got out of control. The other factor was he really didn't think this
was the right decision. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was too early for

ordered it and he had to follow. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Worry not for
there will be two sergeants sent out with you on this journey. Leo,
head of the beast weapon class and Fay; these are two of our
strongest sergeants, so even if you do run into high-level beasts,
they should be able to help you. I will now let Fay explain how the
portal outing will work for all of you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay then took over
and walked to the podium. By the time she had arrived, Nathan had
already left the hall. He had already done everything he needed to
do. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;An Orange
portal outing is different from the Green portal outing you did
before. The Green outing is focused on competition between each group
but, the Orange outings focus on working together. Each class will
travel together in groups of fifty. The main goal is exploration.
Portal planets have yet to be fully explored. Each class will head in
a different direction but we shall remain close to each other. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You will
remain in your teams of five while traveling in the larger group of
fifty. Each team will be given a certain device that would be used to
survey the land and map out the terrain. The data recorded will be

use on the planet. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;More details

teams are filled, please come to me; I will randomly assign you to a
group. Please do this now.&quot; Fay commanded. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The hall of students
quickly shifted around with everyone getting into the same groups
they were in before. Quinn, Vorden, and Layla reminded in one group.
Technically, Peter and Erin had left their group so there were two
spaces left vacant. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, now known as

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn looked
around the room, he noticed once again that Fex was all on his own.
During his time at school, he really hadn't spent time with anyone
else other than Quinn and the others. And due to the low level
indicated on his watch, the other teams that were laking in people
totally avoided eye contact with him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the others
thought that what Quinn was trying to do wasn't the right move. They
were sure that Fex was hiding something, but at the same time, they
weren't surprised. Recently, Quinn and Fex had been hanging out with
each other more often, so an occurrence as such was expected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perhaps, this
is an instance of keeping your friends close but your enemies
closer,&quot; Vorden said as quietly as possible. Right now, he was
standing next to Layla. Thus, he had said those words loud enough
just for her to hear, even slightly leaning his body towards her ear.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Layla looked up,
she could see Vorden staring down at her. After meeting his gaze, she
knew that the comment was being directed at her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was the urge
inside her to retaliate and say something back, but after their last
conversation, she just felt defeated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of a sudden, Fex
came rushing over towards the others. The group didn't really know
what to say. They hadn't;t really attempted to make much conversation
with him because they were afraid they might say something that would
give Quinn away. After all, they were aware of the awkward situation
he was in. So they would just allow Quinn to deal with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess you
guys realized how lame your group is.&quot; Fex said, his tone
indicated that he was proud of himself. &quot;So, you immediately
needed me to boost it up a level. Well, if you really insist.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Upon hearing that,
an awkward smile made its way to Quinn's face. He merely wanted to be
close to Fex, hoping he could eventually learn more about the vampire
world. After what happened on the last portal outing, he became
incredibly worried. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn had
gotten stronger, he still wasn't strong enough to deal with the
weakest of the Dalki. Also, he couldn't imagine how powerful the
vampires, who were coming after Fex, would be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Accordingly, one
thing was simple - He needed to get stronger faster. There were only
two days left before the next portal outing. As he thought about ways
to boost his strength, there were a few things that came into his
mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One, he still hadn't
studied with the new tutorial videos that had been unlocked after
learning the vampire martial arts. Adding more variety to his attack
skills would always come in handy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another way for
Quinn to get stronger was to obtain more skill points. There were
several shadow skills he had yet to unlock. However, to get stat
points, he needed to level up his current shadow abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And the final way to
get stronger was to increase his stats. He could either level up, but
the amount of exp required for the next level up would increase
significantly. By just playing the game, he wouldn't be able to make
a measly dent on it. He could go around challenging random people.
Nevertheless, while the others thought he was a level one and with
the school on alert, that wouldn't be in the list of his best ideas. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, there was
another way that he could utilize to increase his stats and strength
- It was entirely unique to him and that was by obtaining the blood
of as many different people as possible. When Quinn saw how useful
Fex' charm ability was, he felt like there might be a way for him to
quickly do this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, when he had
tried this method on a few students as he passed the halls, it was
unsuccessful for the most part. To the few that they were successful
on, Quinn could only remove their memory, yet was unable to command
them to move. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This meant that it
wasn't much use unless he could find a student that would fit the
criteria of the skill. If he wanted to go through with this plan, he
would need more stat points in his charm skill, which just led him
back to the original problem. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Are there any other
ways to get blood?' As Quinn thought about this, the image of the
city hospital suddenly popped into his head, again. Still, he would
have a problem with the cameras. For now, he would just have to focus
on upgrading his shadow abilities along with learning the tutorial
videos. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While everyone was
huddled up in their groups, there seemed to be three stray students
that had walked up to the front of the assembly hall, going straight
to stand by Fay's side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she looked into
the crowd of people, she started to look at each of the groups. Every
single one of them was already filled with five people. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You over
there.&quot; Fay said, pointing to one student and then to the next
from another group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You there, and
you…&quot; She surveyed the room one more time and her eye had
managed to capture Vorden, who was just at the back. Fay had seen his
face on documents more times than she would have liked, so she
decided to let his group deal with the remaining student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And you, you
can head to those at the back.&quot; She said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others were too
preoccupied with their conversations, busy talking about what they
might expect to find in an orange portal planet. Vorden was the one
with the most knowledge in the group, and he was saying how it varied
from place to place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The orange portal
was in the midst of two stages. Once the whole Planet had been
explored, they would use the information that they had gathered to
update it's status to green or red. Although it was usually a task
that would take a few months to accomplish, so it was unlikely they
would be able to get much done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, a voice
echoed loudly within the hall. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hello?&quot;
Cia said as she entered the circle. She then turned her head towards
Vorden and started to wave her hand in front of the young man's face.
</FONT></FONT>

here? Look, I'm not interested.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She proceeded to
glance at Layla and gave her a wave too. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, Quinn
became curious about what was happening, so he decided to inquire,
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sergeant Fay
has asked me to join your team. You see, the team I was in before,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the question
asking about their abilities arose, everyone in the circle was a bit
hesitant to answer. After all, it was an awkward question due to it
being quite personal. It was as if you're revealing your weakness to
another person. However, at the same time, it should be a given to
know your teammates' abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although, the main
problem was that the school still didn't know about Quinn's ability.
As for Peter, they assumed that he still had his duplication ability
- The ability of the student he was currently imitating as. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't have
an ability.&quot; Quinn quickly answered all the while he lifted up
his wristwatch to show Cia that he was a level one. After seeing
this, she quickly ignored him and moved onto the next person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was fine with
this since this expedition would be quite different. The whole class
would be travelling together for the orange portal expedition. Thus,
he would have to hide his abilities to the rest of the class. Hiding
them from one more person wouldn't hurt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I already know
Layla's, and most people learnt about that pretty boy after the event
with the second years in the assembly hall. That means I just need to
know yours.&quot; Cia said as she looked towards Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter then gave Cia
a rather uncordial glance, since he wasn't in a great mood. What
annoyed him wasn't Cia's attitude towards him, but her disregard for
Quinn, his master. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can show you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Pet...Pio!&quot;

went back to his master's side. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell
was that all about?&quot; Cia asked in bewilderment. She knew her
teasing could piss off some people at times. Hence, because of this,
she was usually quite cold at gauging people's snapping points and
when to stop. Still, Peter's outburst seemed a little abrupt to her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't you

Vorden questioned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, my
ability will be a little hard to explain, so why don't I just show
you?&quot; Cia looked at all the people in the group. At first, she
would have tried using her ability against Peter. However, judging by
how he acted, she didn't want to do that now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of all the
people in the group, there seemed to be one target that stood out as
the weakest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Cia lifted her
hand, smoke gradually appeared on top of her palms - The smoke was
coloured in the shade of blue that the skies had. It started to form
a certain shape - its body was similarly hued to the smoke. After a
brief window, a pointed blade emerged on one end of the fully formed
thin rod. The final product was a short spear, spanning half of Cia's
height, made of animate smoke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without warning, she
looked towards her target and threw the spear. It flew through the
air and managed to hit Quinn dead in the chest. The spear had
permeated his body, a part of it protruding on his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others couldn't
believe that Quinn had just been attacked right in front of their
eyes. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn!&quot;
Layla shouted. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the spear had
made contact with Quinn, he felt no pain. Although he could feel the
object piercing him, it didn't seem to have inflicted any physical
damages - No bruises, scratches, or holes where blood could trickle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still and all, there
was definitely an effect. Part of his energy felt like it was being
absorbed by the weapon. It was a similar feeling of when he was out
in the sun, only a lot weaker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was outraged,
having the urge to lash out at Cia, but suddenly, he could feel an
immense amount of pressure burning the side of his body - It was
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What...did you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others had never

with rage, Quinn started to walk towards Cia. Right now, Quinn was
unsure what Cia's skill was. All he knew was it had reduced his stats

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is this guy really
a level one?' Cia thought as she looked into the anger that was
swimming in Quinn's eyes. She wasn't sure if she imagined it or not,
but she thought she could see the colour of his eyes slowly starting
to turn red. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Quinn,
relax.&quot; Fex said as he jumped in between the two of them before
Quinn could even act. He then leaned forward and whispered to Quinn,
making sure his body and head was blocking Cia from seeing him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, your

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as Quinn
thought about how hard he had worked to gather those stat points and
them going away just like that, his anger started to boil again. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The spear that

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, did you
really think I would hurt you in front of all these teachers and
students? It looks like I've joined a team of crazy people.&quot; Cia
complained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A support
ability?&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia simply nodded as
a response to Vorden's query. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason Vorden
hadn't reacted the same way as the others were, was because he had
seen this type of ability before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm guessing
that it's the spirit drain ability. Am I correct?&quot; Vorden
inquired further. &quot;It allows the user to form spirit weapons in
their mind. When this spirit hits its target, it can either act as a
buff or debuff. There are different types of spirit abilities. If
this is spirit drain, then this acts a debuff on the user. I don't
know the finer details about it though.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you,&quot;
Cia said. &quot;I knew someone on the team would have a brain. Like
he said, my ability when it hits, it is able to debuff the target for
five seconds and then the effect wears off. The good thing about it
is that the spears can also stack up. In that time frame, the more
spears impaled into the target's body, the heavier the debuff.
Because I'm only a level three though, the amount of time the spear
lasts is only three seconds and the distance I can throw the spear is
quite short.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others didn't
want to admit it, but having Cia in the team would be a great
addition. Support type abilities were greatly sought after. The
problem was that they were also very unpopular. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, support
abilities required one to work with a team. Without them, they were
pretty much useless. Cia's spears didn't inflict much damage to its
target. It would only drain their energy and stats. Meaning, while
she was using her spears, it would be best if someone else dealt with
the target. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For this reason,
many people tend to overlook this ability whenever they're about to
pick, since it was hard to be defenceless in a battlefield. Although
there were the plus sides, if one was to select a support ability, it
meant that they would easily be able to join a faction in the future.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Anyway, it
looks like this group won't amount to much.&quot; Cia uttered.&quot;
So why don't we just meet up on the day of the portal outing? There's
no point training together within the two days left prior to the
expedition.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But…&quot;
Ahead of arguing her case, Quinn interrupted Layla's speech. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I agree. Why
don't we all do our own thing before the portal outing? It's been a
tiring week and I think some of us can do with some rest.&quot; Quinn
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the others
could even say anything, Cia was already walking off. The assembly
had ended and students were told that, until the portal outing, they
would have the next two days off. This was to make up for the weekend
that they would, most often than not, utilize to rest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The idea was also to
allow the students to focus on teamwork. It was a free period, still,
the teachers encouraged the students to ask them for help and

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The VR room was the
best place to practise and now that he also had access to Logan's
private server it meant Quinn could also practise his shadow
abilities freely. If there was no way for him to get blood at the
moment then that meant he would just have to focus on learning more
skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing
Quinn was going to do was have a look at the new tutorial video he
had unlocked after learning the vampire martial arts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Was the name of the
video. It made sense that the new skill was somehow related to a
punch since the vampire martial art mainly focused on using hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hello there!&quot;
The blonde man in a cheery voice said in the video. Once again the
blonde man was in a martial arts hall with wooden floors and such.
Quinn started to think about just where the place was located. Was it
on earth, like the system AI said or maybe another place? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, the mystery
also remained just who this blonde man was. If only Quinn was able to
trust Fex enough. He would try to find a way to show what the blonde
man looked like to Fex. Maybe he would have an answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems you
are progressing quite well. Unfortunately, my talents never really
seemed to fit in well with the vampire martial arts and I thought you
two might stray from this path. But just in case I decided to include
this video if the user ever decided to learn it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;In my opinion,
this is one of the most useful skills to have. But just a little
warning, this skill seems to work better with beings with a high
level of intelligence. Namely humanoid creatures. When testing this
against a beast it has little to no effect.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sharing this
disappointed Quinn a little. He was just about to go on an Orange
portal outing where there were plenty of beasts. Still, the skill
would be useful, Dalki, vampires and humans all fell into the
humanoid category and lately, it seemed like Quinn was going to be
attacked by them a lot more than beasts these days. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;To perform
this skill based on the system stats you will need at least 15 points
of agility and 10 points of charm. These are the minimum
requirements. Now as you increase your points into Charm and Agility
this skill will work even better. This is a skill that instead of
evolving by using it more and more. It evolves with your stats.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This sounded a
little confusing at first but Quinn felt like he understood. After
using the blood swipe multiple times it had eventually evolved, this
was the same with blood spray and also the shadow skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like
whatever skills were related to the Charm stat, would evolve, or
become more powerful as the stat related was increased. Such as his
Daze and influence skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This skill
will be a tricky one to show, so you will have to listen to my
explanation very carefully.&quot; The blonde man said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man then brought
out a human mannequin that appeared to be made of foam. He blasted
out throwing his fist just touching the mannequin ever so slightly.
The set of moves and punches he had used were the same that he and
Fex had learnt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, I'm going
to chat a little bit just for the video and show you how the skill
would look.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The blonde man took
a deep breath, and then suddenly threw out a punch lightning fast
towards the head. It was a perfect hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of the
impact was heard but when looking at the video, there was no such
mark on the mannequin head. When taking a closer look, instead of a
marking on the head, there was a fist mark on the body instead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'But I was sure I
saw him aim for the head? When did he hit the body?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As I said
before this is just a demonstration of what the skill looks like and
not me actually using the skill. This is the phantom punch. While in
a fight, you will aim your punch in a certain direction to start,
before the first movement is made, your charm skill will take slight
control of the user's mind, to them an image will appear and make it
look like the punch has continued heading in the initial direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But in actual
fact, this will be a phantom punch, while the user is dodging or
trying to block it, the real blow will come from somewhere else. This
skill works even better if you have high enough agility. You will be
able to perform several phantom punches at once confusing your
opponent. But be careful just like with daze it has a chance of not
working well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is why I
recommend you increase your charm points when possible. What I just
did was not the real phantom punch, instead, I decided to just change
the direction of my Punch at such a speed that the video was unable
to capture it. I'm pretty amazing right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing this
line, it reminded Quinn a little bit of Fex. HE was starting to think
whether all vampires were really like this. Arrogant and big headed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The phantom
punch can only be used against real opponents, so there is no way for
me to show just you through the video.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the initial
video explanation was over, as usual, there were a few more videos
which broke down the action slowly bit by bit. Quinn began to watch
the videos. The first video explained the feeling when using the
charm ability on your opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He explained it
saying it should feel similar to when Quinn would use the Daze skill.
He should gather that feeling again and try to focus it through his
eyes. Then using his strong will and the image in his head, he would
be able to project a fist outward. This, in turn, would allow the
opponent to see the same thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next set of
videos explained the hard part, it was combining the two together.
After hearing the explanation Quinn didn't think it would be too
hard. But just practising it, not using it against an opponent, he
found out it was extremely difficult. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was similar to
someone learning the piano. One part of the brain needed to focus and
do a certain action, while the other part needed to do a different
action. The problem was it was the same arm that was meant to be
doing the action. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he projected
thoughts to target the head, and tried punching below, as soon as he
thought too much about hitting the head his fist would automatically
hit upward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, Quinn wasn't
the type to give up. If there was one thing he was good at, it was
the fact that he was able to repeat an action again and again. He
never got bored of doing the same thing over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he repeated the
move several times he slowly started to be able to separate his
thoughts and actions into two separate things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had now lost
count of how many punches he had performed, the good thing though was
he didn't feel tired at all because of the game. However, it did have
a huge impact on his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't know
whether it was because he was in the game, or trying to split his
thought into two, but he would often get headaches as he pictured
himself using the charm ability and forcing the energy outward from
his eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Surprisingly though
in the middle of him practising a notification screen popped up and
not one he was expecting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Your dedication has

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the first
time a stat point had increased without him levelling up or consuming
blood. The system was clear that it was the fact that Quinn had
continually pushed himself when trying to learn the skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, this was a
bigger deal then he thought, maybe there was another way to increase
his stats. If the others worked in the same way, if Quinn went out
and constantly ran until he tired himself out would his stamina
increase? And was this the same for other stats. What if he
continually lifted weights would his strength increase as well? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only problem
with this method would be of course time. It was a lot easier to take
a blood sample of someone and increase his strength this way. In a
situation like the one he was currently in now where he couldn't do
that, maybe it was a good idea to look into it... </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had done
enough practice for now, and he felt like he had done as much as he
could. And yet, he still didn't have the skill in his system, like
the flash step and hammer strike. There were certain combination
skills that didn't appear in the system. Like blood hammer, and using
blood swipe with his shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he felt like
because this was a skill being taught by the system, it would have
shown up like the others before it. Right now there was only one
thing he could do. Just as the system had said if he wanted to
practise and learn how to use it, he would need to use it on a real
opponent. </FONT></FONT>

Perfecting a skill</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were quite a
lot of people in the world that had an interest in technologies. If
one could not make it in the world using their abilities, the only
real avenue and sector that had a lot of potential that anyone with
enough effort and determination could tap into was the realm of
research and technology. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were myriads
of abilities that could help you work better in this field, but
nothing could compare to the greatness of the human mind when it came
to creative thinking, engineering which led to the creation of these
fields. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately for
Nate, he was not one of these people. But knew quite a lot of people
that knew something about the field. Nate had gotten one of these
said people to set up a system, where whenever the Blood Evolver was
online, he would be pinged on the school's watch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Recently, he had
also added the new user ZombieP to that list as well. He was unable
to see the person's game last time but now, he didn't want to miss
out on them. While Nate was relaxing with his best friend Sam as
usual, he received a ping. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately with no
questions asked, Nate started to head off towards the capsule. Right
now both he and Sam were watching their favourite contender. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, I think
you're starting to border on being obsessed with this guy?&quot; Sam
said in a concerning voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's just this
person's growth never seems to slow down. I've grown myself over time
but I'm just wondering where his limits are?&quot; Nate explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had been
matched up with another Level Four user but unlike the ones he fought
against previously. This user was also wearing beast gear around his
chest. Since the first expedition had already happened with each of
the military bases, it was expected that players of the game would
now more likely have at least some level of beast gear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The match had begun,
and Quinn did his usual routine of rushing forward and fighting
head-on. Oftentimes, he would be the aggressor in fights causing the
enemy to slightly panic in the middle of the battle and this time was
no different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing a target
running towards him, the user's paced both of his hands together and
shoot out a hydro pump of water. The stream of water was strong and
fast, but still— due to the distance Quinn could easily avoid it,
but instead of outright avoiding the attack... </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He waited till the
last second and preformed the flash step to avoid the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The water user
seeing this changed his attack slightly. Instead of a large stream of
powerful water, he decided to shoot out smaller fast streams of water
that came out like bullets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again
though—Quinn used the flash step to avoid the next set of shots.
Quinn only had enough stamina to perform three flash steps in one
game, so he had already used up over half his strength and his body
was tied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, he continued
moving and then before the user could use his water bullets again,
Quinn preformed his third flash step appearing behind the user. As he
turned his head around, Quinn made sure to look at him in the eyes
just as the video tutorial had said, he activated his charm the same
way when he used the daze skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now all he needed to
do was project the thought strongly using his mind of aiming to punch
the head, while the real punch would come from below. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything was going
perfect so far and he could really imagine hitting the person in the
head, then his fist made contact, but instead of receiving feedback
from hitting the body, the punch had been blocked with the other
user's hand, which was guarding his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I thought
I did it perfectly, why did my attack go for the head?&quot; Quinn
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had thought he
had perfected the phantom punch already but using it with no opponent
and using it against a real opponent were two different things. With
the pressure to perform perfectly and with the enemy standing in
front of him, his concentration lagged at some point, so his attack
failed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With one of his
other hands, the water user blasted a stream hitting Quinn right in
the stomach and sending him onto the floor. Due to his usage of flash
step multiple times in the fight, he was tired, and his movements
were a little sluggish. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It also seemed like
the Beast Equipment had given his opponent some extra strength. A
blow form Quinn was more powerful than from a normal person— yet he
was able to block it perfectly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly getting up
from the floor. Quinn tried to attack again, but unfortunately it the
result was the same and Quinn ended up on the floor once more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is he
doing?&quot; Nate said. &quot;Why isn't he using his red aura skills?
Or the hammer strike? Why did he waste all his energy using that
fancy footwork at the beginning? Even then, why a punch to the head
without using any feints or tricks to confuse the enemy?&quot; Nate
was thoroughly confused as to why the person he had watched improving
each time he played a match and fought against someone had seemingly
no progress at all in this fight. In fact, he seemed to be suffering
a setback. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, the
match had ended, and Quinn had unsurprisingly lost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate was speechless,
he thought he was the only person who had beaten the Blood Evolver
before and the one he knew now was a lot stronger than before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate wanted him to
remain undefeated until their rematch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the Blood Evolver
had lost in a grand duel or something he wouldn't be so upset, but he
had lost against a simple level four water user. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During the match
though, just like when Quinn was practising he felt like he had felt
something nearing the end of the battle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Match Making is in
Progress.] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, Quinn
went into the next match. Nate stayed and watched carefully but it
seemed to be nearly an exact copy of the last game. After watching
four matches— the Blood Evolver had lost four times in a row. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate wasn't the only
one who had been watching Quinn's matches. There were a few others
who had become fans as well, and they were nearly just as
disappointed as him with the results they were seeing right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Does this mean
that he was really just a hacker?&quot; A spectator said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess so,
they probably patched the game so he can't use his red aura skils
anymore. Without them, it's clear that he's just average when it
comes to hand to hand combat.&quot; Another one commented. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the logical
conclusion the others had come to. No one would usually lose a match
without giving it everything they got, and in the last four games,
Quinn didn't use a single skill other than the flash step and the
failed Phantom punch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on Nate,
let's go. We need to practice, man. We're just wasting time here.&quot;
Sam said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You go ahead,
I'll catch up and head offline when he goes offline.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam could see the
disappointment on Nate's face. It was as if he had just watched his
favourite superhero lose to a villain in a fight. The only thing he
could do know was to give him some space. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After losing five
matches in a row, the only person that kept on watching Blood
Evolver's matches was Nate. He didn't know why, but he felt that
there has to be a reason for all the strange actions that Blood
Evolver did in the past matches. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason for his
thinking was the fact that Quinn had lost every game doing the same
thing. Only an idiot would do the same thing over and over again
expecting different results. Even if he was now unable to use the red
aura anymore— it didn't make any sense. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the next match
started Quinn now looked more confident than he did before. He knew
he was incredibly close. His opponent was a female, the ability, for
now, was unknown as the inspect skill didn't work in-game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn rushed forward
as usual, but this time no attacks were aimed at him. When this
happened it usually meant the person— he was going up against had a
transformation or hardening ability. The perfect opponent for the
phantom strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn lifted his
fist and aimed for the woman's head, as she saw the punch a large
spike appeared from her face. If Quinn was to carry on moving
forward, then the spike would go right through his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She could see the
punch continuing forward and going through the spike, a smile
appeared on her face but suddenly, she felt pain on her stomach as
she keeled over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time, Quinn
went for a blow to the stomach, a spike was formed where the punch
would make contact, but then sharp pain assaulted the woman on the
side of her head. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn continued
using the phantom punch in this fashion, successfully landing hit
after hit while on the outside Nate who was watching the entire thing
was deeply confused. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All he could see was
Quinn's opponent, forming spikes and blocking the attacks in the
wrong places. It was clear where the punches were coming from so why
was she constantly blocking in the wrong place? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The match had

confirmed to Quinn that he had learned Phantom Punch, everything got
a lot easier from then onwards. Instead of concentrating on the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the next matches
Quinn played, while using the skill he had learnt quite a bit about
how the skill worked. Just like the system had said, there were some
opponents the skill was less effective against, Quinn couldn't figure
out why as it didn;t seem to be linked with the user's ability level.
Most likely it was more to do with their mental ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some of the
opponents he faced, It seemed like they were only partly tricked. On
their end, they would see the phantom punch, but it would disappear
before it would make contact. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While for those with
weaker minds, it felt like they could actually feel the phantom punch
hitting them. Still, even a slight phantom image gave Quinn a huge
advantage. The constant use of the punches, on top of his speed, made
his opponents feel like they were fighting against someone with extra
hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He now understood
why the blonde man had said the skill would improve as he improved
both his agility stat, along with his charm stat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After defeating the
five opponents, Quinn had obtained ten experience points from each of
them. It wasn't his goal, but a bonus along the way of learning the
new skill. He also continued to get the ten points for completing his
daily quests, drinking the two litres of water daily along with
avoiding the sun for eight hours. But still, out of everything so
far, the quickest way to level up was defeating Beasts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn would
definitely need to use this to his advantage when fighting on the
other planet. There was also the chance for him to level up even
quicker since the system had stated that when fighting along with
Peter, he would gain the experience of Peter's kills as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the hours of
practice and the many matches Quinn had played, he didn't realise the
time and the VR pod machines had been shut off. They usually turned
off an hour before the curfew time and the disconnection of him form
the game was a clear sign. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn headed back
to his room, and with one day remaining before the portal outing, he
started to think what would be the next best step on trying to get
stronger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In his mind, Quinn
split up his skills into four different categories. He had his blood
abilities, such as Blood Swipe, Blood Spray, Blood Bank and so on.
These skills could be upgraded by using them multiple times. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then had his
charm skills. Daze, Influence, and now, Phantom Punch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next section he
counted was his fighting skills, such as Flash Step, Hammer Strike,
as well as Blood Hammer and Phantom Punch. Although the last two
skills where a combination of the other sections. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally though, were
his ability skills. The shadow skills. After looking at all his
different skills, Quinn decided to focus on the shadow skills. There
were currently still four shadow skills greyed out in the system that
required him to use skill points to unlock. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only way Quinn
knew of to get skill points, was to upgrade the level of his current
shadow skills. To do this, it worked the same way as his blood
skills. The more he used them, eventually, it would level up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the best
option for Quinn while in the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day had
arrived, and as the group agreed, everyone was currently doing their
own thing. Everyone was kind of pleased that they had decided to do
this. At first, Quinn was a little bit worried about Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when he asked
what Peter was planning to do, Peter was already heading off to
Logan's room with a bunch of sandwiches held in his arms. It seemed
like the two were getting on well enough that Quinn no longer needed
to use his blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While heading to the
game room, he noticed Fex had decided to come along as well. There
wasn't much for him to do in the game after all. When Quinn entered
the game, he decided to watch a couple of Fex's matches. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It came to surprise
that Fex seemed was playing online rather than using the private
server. Because just like Quinn, they were both unable to use thier
abilities inside the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After watching a
couple of games, he could see that Fex was able to beat his opponents
without using his blood skills, or string abilities. He purely used
his body and martial arts to overpower his opponents. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During the second
match, Fex had meant someone quite skilfully and for the second time,
Quinn had seen him use an improvement of the martial arts that were
taught to him. the first time was during the match against Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this just
reminded Quinn again that he needed to get stronger. Quinn backed out
of the game and joined the private server where he was able to use
his shadow abilities freely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing
Quinn activated was Shadow Void. Soon, the room, instead of white,
was now covered in purple shifting shadows above. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn planned to
level up his level 1 shadow skills first. Since they were lower
levels, they would take less use to level up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently, the
shadow skills that were level 1 were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Shadow Control and
Shadow Void. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For each level up of
a skill, Quinn gained ten stat points. Right now, he was aiming for
the skill in his system that cost the most amount of skill points.
The skill known as Shadow Eater, costing a total of fifty points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He repeated the
process of activating the skills as many times as he could, and due
to it being in the game and the lobby, he didn't run out of MC
points. Eventually, Shadow Void levelled up to level 2. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn could now
decide how big the shadow void created was, and depending on its
size, it would either cost far more or far fewer points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other skills
that levelled up were his Shadow Cloak, which was now level 3, along
with his Shadow Equip, which was level 3 as well. The time used to
cast these skills were incredibly fast and it seemed like the cloak
skill now used more shadows to hide him, making it even harder for
him to be seen by those with good perception. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately, the
only skill that hadn't levelled up for him was his Shadow Control
skill, the most useful and powerful skill in his arsenal. The skill
allowed him to combine it with his Blood Swipe, as well as block
incoming attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But it seemed like a
skill that only had its use when used against an opponent, and
unfortunately, Quinn was unable to use the shadow abilities in the
game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was some good
news though. When levelling up the skill from level 2 to level three,
the number of skill points given to him increased. Instead of ten per
level up, he was given fifteen, giving him a total of thirty skill
points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But it still wasn't
enough for him to unlock the skill Shadow Eater. The day had come to
an end, and Quinn would just have to be satisfied with improving his
current shadow skills and learning the Phantom Punch for now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the day had

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Presently, the first
year students were abiding their time inside the canteen. Every one
of them was seated in their groups within their classes. Meanwhile,
their respective homeroom teachers were standing at the end of the
long table. On this expedition, each teacher would be travelling with
their group of fifty students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Two of the
sergeants, Fay and Leo, would be taking charge of the expedition.
Only, they would be moving slightly ahead of the whole group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon, the classes
were called, one by one, into the portal room. Finally, Del's class
was called, so all of the students belonging in that group began to
prepare their things ahead of going through the portal. Standing at
the front was Del, the portal glowing with orange light served to
illuminate his figure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although, this time,
Del looked different compared to his usual self. Usually, when
teaching a class, he would be wearing the standard uniform that the
teachers wore. This time the uniform could hardly be seen beneath the
beast gear clothing that he donned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The thing was, the
armour he was wearing didn't look like beast gear at all and looked
more like a mage outfit. From head to toe, it looked like he was
dressed in robes, but if inspected closer, certain accessories could
be seen around his wrists and legs. Furthermore, instead of a weapon,
a shield was mounted on his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before giving his
speech to the students, he decided to survey the whole group. He
could feel the sweat dripping from his forehead, thinking, 'I can't
believe that the school is really doing this. Why do we homeroom
teachers have to go along with them? These kids don't even know what
could possibly be on the other end. If they did, they would be just
as nervous as me.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All these fearful
thoughts were running through Del's head. In the past, he had done an
orange portal expedition. Because of that, he was aware that the
results of the expedition could turn around for the worse, it was
like flipping a coin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In some places, it
would be a walk in the park while other times it would feel like they
had been sent to hell. For fear of being sent inside the portal once
more, he elected to become a teacher, but it seemed as if fate was
toying with him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can every
group present please raise their orange scanning devices!&quot; Del
said, his voice loudly resounded within the hall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Del asked, the
representative of each group showed themselves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For Quinn's group,
it was Peter. Once again, he was in charge of carrying the group's
supplies and this included the scanner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only difference
this time was that Peter actually had volunteered to help his master.
It also made sense, since Peter was fairly sturdy and had a lot of
strength. Thier were advantages such as his unlimited stamina, so he
wouldn't get exhausted that easy by carrying heavy objects. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I will now
explain and show you how the scanner works. I will only explain once,
so listen up.&quot; Del said as he raised the scanner for everyone to
see. &quot;The scanner is fairly simple to use. You will only need to
point it at an object. You can see that, on the screen, you can
select the area or item that you want to scan. Then, once you
confirm, the scanner will do the rest for you. Simple, right? So
remember, don't mess it up.&quot; Del said in a slightly annoyed
voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A single student
raised their hand, but Del decided to completely ignore him as he
continued on with his explanation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The scanner
can be used to scan almost anything - buildings, beasts, plants,
water and so on and so forth. It will try its best to break down the
information it has received and display it on the screen for you.
Although, this is not the goal of the expedition.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del halted his
speech, heaving a sigh before resuming. His irritation was starting
to get the best of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What you
students need to do is look for things on the planet which have never
been scanned before, and this includes beasts. In your teams, each
newly scanned object will earn you points. If another team, or the
item has been scanned before, you will receive no points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now for the
most important and very crucial part. There is quite a range on these
scanners - Before engaging in combat, it will scan every beast that
is within your vision. The most useful thing about these scanners are
that, even if they have never seen a beast before, it will be able to
tell you what level the beast is at.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the
explanation with the scanners was over, Del went on to tell them how
the expedition would work between the classes. Each class, together
with their homeroom teacher, would be sent off in a certain area.
When they reached their assigned space, the class would stay there
for a while, allowing every one of the students to scan the area
thoroughly. If they were to run into a beast with a tier higher than
intermediate, they were advised to fall back and tell the teacher
immediately. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The homeroom teacher
would then inform the generals, who would come to their aid as soon
as physically possible. In total, there were ten classes. Hence, Fay
and Leo would stay in the centre of these classes, so they could
respond to each of their calls of distress as quickly as they could. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Del's
lecture was finished, the groups began making their final
preparations. While Quinn was looking around, he noticed that Logan
was already tinkering around with the scanner, no doubt making
adjustments in the scanner's system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wouldn't surprise
Quinn if Logan was able to change the readings to allow his team to
get the top score. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of a sudden, he
felt a soft touch on his shoulder, interrupting his observations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
need one of these if we're going outside?&quot; Fex said as he waved
a strange object in front of Quinn. It looked like a flask made out
of a silver metal. The only difference was that, on the facade of the
flask, a skull that had two sharp fangs on the upper jaw was
displayed - It was definitely a strange design for Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at it
closely, Quinn realized that the design was utterly similar to the
one that the book had - The one that had given him his powers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's that?&quot;
Quinn asked without really thinking about what he had just said. He
was unsure whether this was common knowledge among the vampires or
not. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is a
special flask that allows us to hold blood inside. If you used a
normal flask, the blood would spoil in a matter of a few days.
However, this one is specially used within the circle of vampires to
keep blood fresh. Well, that is as long as it remained inside the
flask. By the way, every vampire is given one.&quot; Fex explained.
&quot;If you're going to another planet with beasts as its main
population, then it's best to bring one of these with you. We'll be
gone for a week and I don't want to be turning into a blood sucker.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing those
words, a specific memory came flooding back in Quinn's mind. It was
related to the time when he did turn into a blood sucker. Fex seemed
to not rely on blood as much as Quinn. Perhaps, it was because he was
closer to the next evolution. But, for Quinn, if he didn't receive
blood within two days, he would turn into a blood sucker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thankfully though,
Quinn now had the blood bank. That, in a way, acted the same way as
the flask. Still, even last time, Quinn had used up his blood bank in
a fight and eventually, he was starving for blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In this occasion,
there were others to rely on. Though it was unlikely that their group
would be split again, there was always the chance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But if vampires were
required to carry around such a flask, was the blood bank also a
unique skill amongst the system, one that other vampires didn't have.
It had saved him so many times in the past. If Quinn could he would
have definitely tried levelling up as fast as he could but after many
battles, it still hadn't done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So do you have
a spare one of these?&quot; Quinn asked as he eyed the flask. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course,
that's why I came over. If you didn't have the basic ring, I didn't
think you would have the flask either.&quot; Fex then pulled out a
similarly styled flask from the inside of his shirt and handed it
straight over to Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After spending some
time with Fex, Quinn really couldn't say that he was a bad guy and he
seemed to be growing on him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Maybe during this
trip, I can finally ask about his shadow powers?' Fex thought, yet
for some reason, while contemplating the matter, he felt guilt in his
conscience and didn't really know why it was the case. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When going through
the portal, the group made sure to hold on to the person in front of
them tightly. Last time it wouldn't have been such a big deal, if
they were to disconnect and let go. Although this might have caused
them to split up, they were guaranteed to teleport somewhere safe in
the shelter, but this time was different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Shelters were often
incomplete, and sometimes not all of the spawn areas had been marked
yet. So the possibility existed that they could be chucked deep into
beast territory, and be left there all on their own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fear could be
felt in Cia's shoulders as Layla gripped on tightly. While Cia was
starting to move her hands towards a certain place on Vorden's body.
She inched closer and closer and went down lower. If they weren't in
the middle of being warped, he would have turned around and pushed
her, but even Vorden wasn't that cruel, and Raten wasn't complaining
one bit about what was happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the
distorted space was ending and white light could be seen up ahead.
When the white light vanished a bright light entered their eyes and
they felt stunned. Their eyesight slowly started to return and the
first thing the group could see was green, lots and lots of green.
More specific, giant green trees. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please, step
aside and allow the other students to arrive!&quot; A loud voice said
as he pointed to his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like last time,
they had arrived in one of the areas that had been circled off. When
looking at the person who had given them commands, he hardly looked
any older than them. Most likely a recruit who had just graduated and
decided to stay with the army. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group went over
to where the man pointed and it seemed there were other groups of
students standing by the side waiting as well. There were also
several soldiers checking and coordinating with them. Making sure
they stayed in place and didn't wander off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a lot

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course it
would be,&quot; Cia replied. &quot;A green portal planet is
practically safe, you would have to be a moron to be killed on one of
those. But here, on an orange planet there could be a much higher
risk, so they have to be extra careful.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia's words had
rubbed a lot of the group the wrong way. They had almost been killed
in the Dalki attack, and there were still deep mental scars from it.
Although the students knew of what happened, they weren't informed on
which group of students had encountered the Dalki. Many of them
thought it was only Ben's group that had met them and died. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While standing off
to the side, Quinn was finally able to take a good look at the
shelter they had arrived in, the planet and the shelter itself were
vastly different to the one before. First thing Quinn did was prop up
his trusty umbrella to protect him from the sun, but this time, it
didn't do much to make him feel better. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking around
all that could be seen was green. Giant trees, bushes, vines, and
even plants that Quinn had never seen before. They were now in what
Quinn would call a jungle. This was why Quinn's body still felt
extremely sluggish. The place was humid, hot and sticky and it looked
like he wasn't the only one being affected as everyone around was
sweating heavily as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at
Peter though, he seemed absolutely fine, at this point he was
thinking Peter might have gotten a better class than himself, but
then he started to remember Peter digging into human flesh. Quickly
causing him to abandon that line of thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shelter was
vastly different as well, in a way it looked incomplete. Most of it
seemed to be made from some type of wood and mud, although the
architecture was impressive. They had managed to build upon the large
trees. Incorporating them into their shelter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were stiff
large bridges made from wood and spiralling staircases that would
lead you from floor to floor and tree to tree. The Ground floor where
they were on was mostly empty and only had certain areas that had
been marked out for where the teleportation spots would take you. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking upward,
Quinn could see residential houses and some market shops, although
nowhere near the amount compared to before. But the thing that
surprised him the most, was just how many residential houses there
were on an orange portal planet like this one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is one of
the cheapest places for people to live in,&quot; Layla explained.
&quot;This is a tier five city. So it doesn't have any walls to
protect the citizens, and they're open to attacks. The soldiers will
do their best to protect them, but because this planet is still in
the middle of exploration their focus isn't so much on the shelters
themselves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The citizens
aren't required to pay tax on an orange planet, so those who can't
afford to live on earth, and can't even make a living on a green
portal planet end up here. Of course, red portal planets are just too
dangerous in the first place, and only the strongest of military
shelters and factions are able to survive there.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When hearing about
this from Layla, Quinn started to have strange thoughts. If it was
true those that couldn't afford a place to live on earth had no
choice to be here. Why didn't he end up in one of these shelters like
these kids? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When his parents had
died, a government official had come over and explained to him that
they would look after him until he was sixteen and would provide him
with an apartment until then. So why didn't these kids get the same

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that he thought
about it further, it was also strange when he had received the book
that gave him his vampire abilities at age ten. They were so keen on
trying to keep things for themselves so why did they allow Quinn to
have the book. At first, he thought it was because the book was
useless but now he was starting to have second thoughts about the
whole thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking back, he
really didn't know his parents all that well and they haven't left
much behind beside the book. How did they even get the book in the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like there

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Most likely
sharing information,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;You see on an orange
portal planet there is more than one shelter. Different factions
including the military usually set up a base here. Exploring a planet
is a collective effort. Once they finish scanning their individual
parts of the planet, the shelters share information with each other.
This saves time and money, so the different shelters aren't exploring
parts of the planet that have been explored already. </FONT></FONT>

Quinn decided to use his inspect skill on every new thing he could

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter walked over
to the student. The boy carefully started to analyse who it was that
came towards him, the first thing he did was look at the person's
watch, noticing that he was a level three user. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The one that had
barged into Peter was also a level three ability user but had a
slightly higher level, going into the 3.4 range. Meaning he not only
had the power of a level three ability but the skills to go with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, the levels
felt too close. If the two were to fight and Peters ability was an
offensive one then there was no telling who would win or lose.
Because of the fierce look in Peter's eye, he immediately backed up.
That was until four more students had arrived and were now standing
by his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was one girl
in the group along with the original student and three boys. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on Pio,
Let's just ignore these guys, we're just wasting our time with this
trash, and we can always go and get more points,&quot; Layla said,
quite loudly so the others could hear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You, the
pretty girl stay.&quot; The boy who had given the command was
pointing at Layla. On his wrist was displayed the number 5.2. Seeing
this Layla knew straight away why the boy was so arrogant. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla decided to
ignore this, and started to walk off while pulling Peter by his
sleeve. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I said stay!&quot;
the boy shouted. The distance between the two parties was around
about fifteen meters. But the boy seemed to have closed the distance
at an instant whit his speed, and had already made a fist aiming
towards Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Peter was no
slowpoke himself and noticed the punch, he managed to lift up his arm
blocking the attack from hitting Layla, it hit dead centre on his
forearm between his wrist and elbow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The boy could feel
the impact and even heard a loud cracking sound being made upon
impact. Although the blow wasn't strong enough to snap the bone and
pierce the skin, he knew he had fractured Peter's arm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter felt no pain,
and hadn't even made any sound. The boy hesitated for a moment, but
then saw Peter's hand reaching out to him. He immediately turned
around and ran back to where he was before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at Peter's
arm, Layla could see it was starting to swell, but soon it would
heal, so she wasn't worried about him, she was more worried about
what he would do. It had been a while now and the others had already
noticed the changes in Peter's behaviour. So in the end, Quinn
decided to tell them all the truth. That this was due to his
involvement that brought about Peter's aggressive nature. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the boy was about
to say some clever remark. Quinn and the others had arrived,
including both Vorden and Cia. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing
Quinn had noticed was also Peter's arm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter who did
this to you?&quot; Quinn asked in annoyance. Just from the direction
Peter was looking at, Quinn could tell which one it was. Peter
wouldn't stop staring at him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you think
you can just hurt our teammate in the middle of an assessment?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn you know
you can't fight using your full strength let's just leave it be,&quot;
Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia watching the
whole thing thought Quinn was crazy, was he really trying to have a
go at the other team. Of course it made sense that one would be angry
if they were to injure a teammate, but Quinn was a level one. What
could he do? Most of the time low levels were completely afraid of
anyone above them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I guess he will
learn his place...' Cia thought to herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, umbrella
boy, why are you the leader…&quot; As the boy said that, he started
to look at Quinn's wristwatch, and started to blurt out in a laugh.
&quot;You should be down on your knees begging for me to show you
mercy, boy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had a fake
smile on his face, hiding the anger behind it. &quot;Why would I beg
with someone weaker than me?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that point, the
boy was too aggravated. He was already annoyed at the fact that a
level one even tried to talk back to him. The boy used his super
speed ability, to launch off his feet at amazing speed going straight
for Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You should
have just said sorry,&quot; Cia said watching from behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The speed was
impressive, and was even faster than Quinn at top speed, but there
was one skill where speed meant nothing. He looked into the boy's
eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had used the
skill at just the right time, and the boy had stopped right in front
of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You broke my
friend's arm, so it's only right I break yours,&quot; Quinn said as
he grabbed and pulled one arm forward while slamming his fist down on
the forearm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had tried his
best to contain his strength when dealing the blow, but it was still
too strong, with his gauntlets equipped his strength was just too
high. Unlike with Peter, the boy's bone had snapped and pierced the
skin on the outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Howls of pain were
heard immediately. His friends were shocked. They didn't know what
happened, but it looked like the boy had stopped just in front of
Quinn, and let himself get hit by him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Was he too cocky?'
They thought. Maybe because it was a level one, he was trying to give
Quinn a chance, not realising he had some strength or a very weak
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as they saw
their friend injured though, each of them drew their weapons and
prepared their ability. While Quinn's group had done the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Vorden wasn't
too happy about the current situation. Because he hadn't copied any
useful ability he could use in a fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia was a little
nervous as well as this was the last outcome she had expected, but
right now she was on Quinn's team, and would help her own team out if
a fight was to start. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two groups
looked like they were ready to clash, but before they even got the
chance a loud bang was heard. When they looked over in the direction
of the bang, they could see that Del had placed his large shield down
hitting it into the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two groups were
only around fifty meters from the outskirts of where they were
before. The scream was so loud that it had caught Del's attention,
and he immediately came rushing over after checking there were no
beasts around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Enough!&quot;
he shouted. &quot;This event is about working together. Although it
is a competition this is only to encourage you to work harder rather
than slack off. You are not to fight against each other.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del then looked at
the boy's arm who had been broken. &quot;Take him to the centre, I'll
see if there is anyone with a healing ability that can help him out.
As for you guys.&quot; Del said pointing at Quinn and the others. He
still hadn't forgotten both Vorden and Quinn's face. They were the
two students who had made him risk his life in the red portal world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For severely

for whatever total score you receive on today's assessment.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But they
attacked us first!&quot; Layla complained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see no
injuries on any of your party members,&quot; Del replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they went to
look at Peter, they found out it was true. Peter's arm had already
healed and it didn't look like he had even been hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the group
was to take their punishment and carry on with the task. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, we
need to be more aggressive if we still want to come out on top while
we're already at a disadvantage,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The team nodded and
got to work again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group was fifty
points behind now, which was the same as them finding ten plants.
That one argument over a single plant had cost the team a lot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Cia tried not to
smile. How could these guys be crazy enough to think that they could
come back from a deficit like that? However, crazy wasn't actually
bad, Cia liked crazy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although, there was
still one thing she couldn't understand. It seemed like everyone in
the group was listening to Quinn's orders, not only that but when he
was being aggressive with the other team, not a single one of them
had stepped in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The battle for
points was fierce as students continued to run around the area
scanning every item in sight. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn this has

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, there's

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the weaker
groups decided to stay together as a group as they went around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although this
stopped other teams from snatching points from them, their progress
was relatively slower than those who roamed alone. The stronger
groups decided it would be best to split up, this way they were able
to cover a wider range, while the other groups decided to do a
mixture of something in between. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though the
group thought that Del was being harsh in his punishment, it wasn't
truly the case. He had planned to do something similar beforehand but
wasn't quite sure how to do it until the incident gave him an excuse.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's group had an
extra person, so they were at an advantage compared to others. But
since there was only one scanner, it was hard to say how much extra
influence an extra member could give. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But after seeing
Vorden and Quinn's face once more, his emotions got the better of him
as a teacher, and he decided to give them quite a setback. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of the
strategies implemented by different groups... In order to catch up to
the others, Quinn's group decided to do a mixture of the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They decided that
they would travel around in pairs. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Peter,
Layla and Vorden, and lastly Fex and Cia. In the beginning there was
some disagreement with the pairings, but eventually they agreed on
this setup, at the end of the day it would be better for Peter to be
with Quinn, and Vorden refused to team up with Cia, so that left him
with Layla and Fex with Cia to make the relative strength of each
group about the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was important for
them to have one strong member with a support type member. Although
Layla and Cia could have gone together, if they were to confront a
beast, or a similar situation happened with Peter there wasn't much
that they could do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group had
already split up, and while everyone was off looking for some new
items to discover, Quinn noticed something peculiar. There were ten
groups yet, nearly every group had a single member that acted as a
type of mule. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A person designated

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a closer
inspection, he also noticed that these mules were people who had the
lowest levels in their group. But nevertheless, they would still
wander off and look around as instructed by their team. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Wouldn't this be
the perfect chance?' Quinn thought. Right now, they weren't in
school, and many of the students had separated from each other. If he
was to take a sample of their blood and mind control them afterwards
to forget what had happened, no one would ever know what he had done.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was basically the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Pio, over

that Cia had yelled but Quinn didn't follow. Instead, he set his eyes
on a target. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A lone female
student had been designated to carry her team's luggage. She seemed
to be disheartened by the whole thing, and was searching through the
trees and vines in a crestfallen manner. It was obvious that she
didn't feel that she was doing anything substantial or that she was
even a part of the team. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she bent down to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn grabbed her
hand as fast as he could and made a small scratch on her palm, her
blood was now on the tip of his gauntlet. After placing it on his
tongue the system message appeared. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a little bit
of a disappointment but Quinn was hoping to obtain as much O type

his selection was limited. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had to choose
low-level students with lacklustre abilities who most likely had a
weak mind too. But if his charm skills eventually increased, the pool
of people to choose from would also increase directly proportional to
his charm skills. </FONT></FONT>

started to glow slightly red showing that his skill was active. Quinn
informed the girl to forget about the event that just occurred.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before ending the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the others
were busy calling out to Peter and looking for new things, Quinn was
looking around to see if he could spot any other strays, that weren't
with their group, and which was also in a well-hidden area as if they
were hiding their shame and embarrassment to the others due to being
designated as a luggage-carrying mule. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay and Leo were
standing together at the starting point where all the groups had
split off. They stood there silently. Leo didn't talk much, and Fay
didn't really know how to speak with him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, a beeping

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll get to
it!&quot; Fay said as she stormed off at lightning speed in the
direction of one of the paths. Fay was meant to be the first one to
respond since her ability was super speed, but she felt even more
obliged to act due to the awkward situation between her and Leo. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo continued to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Another one?&quot;

there aren't any more calls.&quot; Leo said as he started to run
towards a different direction from where Fay had gone. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the fact that
two signals were sent out at the same time gave Leo some concern. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group had
managed to obtain 25 points in total. They also discovered and
scanned a peculiar type of rock mineral in the mix. Still, they were
vastly behind the others and their weighted points at the end of
everything would be -25. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What they were doing
at this moment wasn't working and they needed a change of plan. The
quickest way for them to earn points would be to find beasts. But
right now, there didn't seem to be any beasts in the area as not a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But once they moved
away from this area at Del's command, which was when Quinn and his

risk it by going up against such things. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, a few
meters away from Quinn, one of the scanners had made three dings. A
sound that he had hadn't heard just yet. Del didn't even bother
explaining to the students the meaning of the dings, but they soon
found out what the sounds meant. </FONT></FONT>

through the trees. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you do
something wrong?&quot; Cia asked. She could tell that Fex was acting
strange ever since he returned. Hearing this, Caused Fex to jolt back
a bit. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I'm just
getting bored. Why would I have anything to hide? Maybe you have
something to hide, and that's why you're accusing me of having
something to hide?&quot; Fex replied back. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had been over an
hour now and the group had a total of sixty points. They had finally
recovered from their deficit. They were unable to see where they were
as none of the groups knew each other's scores. But they had a rough
idea form watching, and with the fifty point deduction, they wouldn't
be surprised if they were still in the last place… </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now when students

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess it's

around his waist, which looked like a larger version of the scanner
the students had. After pressing several buttons on his own scanner.
A sound was heard, and suddenly, none of the students were able to
scan anything at the moment. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every student was
looking into the direction of where the sound was coming. Two of the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The large beast
stood on all fours, and had a long neck. There was no fur, and it
resembled something similar to a dinosaur. Even the size was
something similar to what they would have imagined. The only
difference was on its back it seemed to have a large flower bud. It
completely covered it from its neck to its tail. </FONT></FONT>

up their scanners and immediately started to scan the beast. Size
wasn't always the indicator of strength. Quickly, they realised their

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Guy's we have
to run!&quot; Quinn shouted in a serious tone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They didn't know
why, but Quinn was clearly shocked after seeing the beast. 'Perhaps
it is his vampire senses tingling, telling him this is a strong
beast,' Vorden thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But that wasn't the
case, for Fex stood unaware of the danger in front of them. Some
vampires were able to sense how dangerous a beast was, but Fex's
senses still weren't at that level yet. So to him it just looked like
any other beast, only this one was a little larger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finding out it
was an advanced tier beast, Quinn didn't even think about the
possibility of trying to defeat it for its experience points. Last
time he had fought against an intermediate beast and had almost died.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no way for
Quinn to tell how strong the intermediate beast he fought against
was, some were stronger than others, but whenever there was a jump up
in the level of beast tiers. There was a definite difference in
strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't have the
confidence he could defeat it, and definitely not while hiding his
abilities. Even though Fex was by his side, who had supposedly killed
ten advanced tier beasts? Fex had the same problem as Quinn, where he
was unable to reveal himself in front of this many people. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, honestly if
Fex knew the level of the beast, even he would have been frightened.
Just like when Quinn faced an intermediate beast, Fex had barely made
it out alive in his fight with an advanced tier beast. He wasn't
strong enough to easily deal with one, and definitely not while
hiding his powers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
also frightened, mostly because of the size of the beast. When it
exited from the trees, it had stopped, and was now looking down at
them. The beast was a little larger than a two floor house. While
it's long neck stretched out causing a shadow to be cast over the
students at the front. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the beast,
Del nervously took the larger scanner from his side. His hands were
shaking as he pointed it at the creature, and after a few seconds,
his fears were confirmed. It was an advanced level beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del was never much
of a fighter, and his ability also supported that fact. Immediately,
he started tapping away at his wristwatch. Sending out a distress
signal. In his panic he was unaware of how many times he had pressed
the button. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del just wanted one
of the sergeants to appear in front of them now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of all the
students, Quinn was the first to take a step away, trying to get a
head start on the other students, but the sound of his steps caused
the leaves to ruffle, and the creatures head turned and immediately
looked at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe moving
isn't a good idea,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, while
it's not being aggressive, let's not do anything,&quot; Quinn
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del had felt the
same way, which was why he hadn't shouted at the students to run away
and retreat. The sudden movements could frighten the beasts. Most
beasts were hostile towards humans, but the higher tiers seemed to
have more intelligence, and some would leave humans alone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although, that
didn't stop the humans from hunting them for their crystals. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del was hoping that
the students at least knew this basic knowledge, and wouldn't try
attacking the beast, giving them all the best chance for survival. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The bud on the
beast's back slowly started to open up, revealing a pink centre. Out
of the pink centre, six vines had also appeared rising up in the air
before dropping down and falling to the beast's side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The vines seemed to
be alive and being actively controlled by the beast. Although the
beast wasn't moving, the vines were stretching out from the buds as
if there was no end in sight. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One of the vines had
reached the student closest to the beast. The end of the vine was
slightly larger, and looked similar to the head of the beast itself
but was still green in colour. Right now, the head of the vine was
floating directly about in front of the student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His heart was
beating loudly, and he now had his eyes closed, hoping that if he
couldn't see the beast, it would somehow calm down his nerves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After waiting a
while, and nothing happening. The student eventually opened his eyes,
and right at that moment, the head of the vine opened up and attached
itself to the students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using both hands, he
grabbed onto the vine and tried to pull as hard as he could, but it
was no use. The suction and stickiness of the vine was too strong,
and he couldn't break free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The vine lifted the
student high up into the air and towards the beast's mouth. As it
opened up its mouth, several sharp teeth could be seen, and the beast
took a bite that caused nearly half of the student's body to
disappear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Everyone run!
It's a hostile advanced tier beast!&quot; Del shouted as he ran into
a random part of the jungle. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most of the students
decided to follow where Del had gone. It was an instinct for the
students, when in times of danger, to rely on the adults that were
there. Especially since Del was their teacher, and was meant to be
there for their guidance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast continued
to use its vines to grab the students closest to it, and as they
screamed in pain and cried out for their teachers help. Del closed
his eyes and tried to ignore them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students who had
gotten a head start had managed to create a distance between them and
the beast. The beast still hadn't moved and was busy eating the
students it had managed to catch. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, while Del
was running blindly through the jungle, he was aware of a great
problem. The distress signal sent from the watch was just that, it
was only a signal sent to the sergeants. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As stated before,
the GPS tracker and other features of the watch didn't work well or

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system was
designed so when a signal was sent, the sergeants could tell which
team the signal was coming from. They would then head over in that
direction. If Leo, or Fay was to head there now though, they would no

students had gone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But right now they
had no choice. Suddenly, the loud sound of the footsteps could be
heard coming in their direction once again. The beast was on the move
now that it had finished its snack. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's group was
quite fast, and were just behind Del. Peter had picked up Layla and

with them. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex and Quinn were

Unaware that Del had no plan. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students at the
back could hear the booming footsteps getting louder and louder. In
the end, the temptation got the better of them. They turned around
and were caught by the vines. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the students
were a bit smarter in their movements and would travel in between
trees, making it harder for the beast to catch them. Still, it did
nothing to slow down the main beast's body as it would continue to
bulldoze its way through the trees. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when Del had
made it past another tree, they had finally come out to an open area.
A small vertical wall with vines on it could be seen. Most likely the
side of a mountain. Del thought about attempting to climb it, but it
would take some time for them to scale, time they didn't have,
because by then the beast would catch up with them. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The open area was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking up at
the beast, blood could be seen dripping from its mouth. It was even
quite a shocking site for both Fex and Quinn. They also consumed
blood but this wasn't the same. One of the students intestines could
be seen dangling from the side of the mouth of the beast and even for
them, this was too much. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The vines continued
to hover around the beats side as if they were alive like snakes.
While the main body of the beast charged straight ahead into the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

angered Quinn. If he wasn't going to use his vampire abilities, he
thought he might be able to help out greatly just using his beast

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thanks to Cia's
spear. The beast had slowed down just enough for Quinn to move out of
the way, avoiding the vine whip. Fex and Peter had also now resorted
to dodging after finding out the incredible growth speed of the
vines. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the fact
that the beast was slowed down didn't go unnoticed. A second spear
was thrown and had landed in the same spot on the beast legs. The
effect of two spears had stacked and now the beast was 20 percent
slower than it usually would have been, and also twenty percent
weaker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students took
advantage of this temporary weakness. Their attacks were bouncing off
the beast's thick hide were now doing damage, and the vines that were
troubling started to move slower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, the beast was
strong and even at 80 percent of its strength, it was able to fend
off the attacks form forty different students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia continued to
throw her spirit spears at the beast. At most though, she was only
able to stack up two spears. Whenever she would throw a third spear
into the beast the first one would have already lasted for five
seconds and disappear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her ability was
perfect for situations like this. The beast was a big target and
other then it's vines, it's main body wasn't too fast unless it was
running in a straight line. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If she was to go up
against other beasts, even some intermediate beats, it might have
been harder for her to use her ability, but right now, she was one of
the most important people when it came to taking down this creature. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If only we
could make it even weaker,&quot; Del said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As that moment, a
blonde by stood by Cia's side, and in his hand, he too had a spirit
spear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like you
have quite a good ability there,&quot; Vorden said as he threw the
spear into the beast's leg. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Vorden and Cia
using their sprit spears, the beast now had lost 40 percent of its
overall strength. It was nearly half of what it used to be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
now doing even better than before, and even the ones whos weapons had
been reinforced by Del were working. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quuinn no longer
felt the need for him or Fex to get involved when fighting the beast.
The students that had been brought back by Quinn were getting
treatment from the support students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that the beasts
movements had slowed, they had joined the battle and went to support
their teammates using buffs and other skills. The only one that
remained in position with a smile on his face was Del. &quot;This is
brilliant, it looks like these students might be able to take down
and advance beast after all. I might even get a promotion for this!&quot;
Del thought about excitedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at him,
Quinn felt like he could read his teacher like an open book.
Especially after there earlier interaction. He got the sense that Del
was quite a selfish person and he was right. Even now, although the
situation had gotten better it wasn't perfect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Students still ended
up dying, but all Del could think about was himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After a good fifteen
minutes of constant attacks from most of the students, other than
Quinn, Fex who decided to lay low. Even Peter and Layla were actively
helping. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast now looked
heavily injured. It lifted its front two feet into the air and
slammed them onto the ground. The mass weight of the beast caused the
ground to shake around the students a little. It also served as a
reminder to the other student that this beast was still plenty
strong. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast repeatedly
did this action as it roared and screamed, at the same time, the
vines that were coming off from the bud on its back were swinging
more widely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this,
have the spears warn off or something?&quot; A student said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when looking at
the beast, the spears from Vorden and Cia still remained. They
continued to attack the beast with them. Although at this point, Cia
was feeling incredibly drained along with Vorden. They had been using
their abilities for a while nonstop and didn't know how much longer
they could last. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast using its
long head was now looking over back into the jungle and the next
second it started running off back from where it came. The students
who were stood behind the beast rolled and dived out of the way, for
fear they might get trampled on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Should we
chase it, if it's running away doesn't that mean its nearly dead?&quot;
A student asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn also had the
same thought. If the beast was injured and the others weren't going
to chase it. Then maybe he could. Killing an advanced beast would
gain him an enormous amount of exp points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nobody chase
the beast!&quot; Del shouted. &quot;Some advanced type beasts and
above have something called a berserker mode. Once injured to a
certain point, if the beast feels like it's stuck in a corner. It
will activate its berserker mode, sometimes increasing its strength
several times.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing Del's
explanation, Quinn had second thoughts about chasing the beast. He
was reminded of the strength of the beast before the debuff from
Vorden and Cia. On top of that there where forty students fighting it
at once. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If a single person
was given the task to deal with the advanced beast, Quinn couldn't
imagine anyone coping. All of the vines would be free to attack you
along with the main body of the beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if it didn't
have a berserker mode, Quinn didn't like his chances of beating the
beast alone. This one he would just have to let go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the beast had
reentered the jungle, and a minute had passed without it returning.
They knew that they had achieved a victory. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cheers and
congratulations were shouted out between friends and classmates. They
had managed to survive such an intense ordeal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many of the students
had gone up to those who had put themselves on the front line.
Congratulating them for being brave and attack the beast from the
beginning. This included Del who had come over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was no surprise,
Quinn after all had contributed nothing to cause the beast to run
away. The other students deserved the praise. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then. A female
with light pink hair stepped in front of Quinn and bowed down to him.
As she lifted up her head her eyes were filled with tears. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you…
so much for saving my friend.&quot; The pink haired girl said. After
that, she hurried off to join her teammates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The thanks should
have made Quinn feel good but it didn't. It had made Quinn feel bad
instead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Originally, he had
only gone out there not to save the students, but because he saw it
as an opportunity to take thier blood. Just like Del, his reactions
were because of selfish reasons not because he was trying to be a
hero. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't deserve
the praise. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the students
had all settled down, they decided to have a minute of silence, out
of respect for the students that had been lost. But they couldn't
spend much time for they were in a serious situation right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast had chased
the group quite a distance away from their original location. Not
only that but Del had no clue where they were or how to get back.
When running away he had headed in a random direction and didn; take
note. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thier were no maps
for the planet yet either, since the place they were in was
undiscovered </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do we do
now?&quot; A student asked Del. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo had arrived at
the camp where the distress signal had come from. Before arriving
here he had dealt with two more incidents form other camps. It was
clear this planet was quite active with beasts. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, it was too
early to tell whether it was worthy of the decision to make it a red
portal planet. If there was only a few advanced tier beast and they
got rid of them, then it was possible for them to give the planet a
green grade. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of the
footsteps could be heard loud and clear. Leo was even able to see the
energy as each foot was placed on the ground. He activated his
ability a little more and now his vision was even wider than most
people could see with their own two eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It didn't matter how
many trees or obstacles were blocking his path. Whatever was heading
towards him he would be able to see it clearly. A large flame of red
energy seemed to be spiralling in his direction. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The energy of the
beast seemed to be getting wilder on the outside, but when looking
closer towards the core of the beast's crystal, Leo could see the
energy was actually being more condensed. The flames of aura were
entering the crystal while the leftovers were sparkling on the
outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was what

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If it gets to

he drew out his trusty sword. There was no need for Leo to move from
the spot he was in, the beast was already coming towards him so he
stood there and waited. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately six,
lines of red energy came whipping out at Leo. Focusing his mind, he
waited until all paths of the red energy crossed each other, at that

was going to be, with a single movement he drew all of his energy out
and pulled the blade out of its sheath as fast as he could. A line of
energy had left the sword right as it was taken out of its sheath. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The line of energy
was thin and white in colour, but the beast had no time to react and
it had completely passed through its neck. A few moments later and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After defeating the
beast he didn't stop for a moment, not even to extract the crystal
core from its body. He didn't have much time to investigate the area
before, and the beast had suddenly come out and attacked him. </FONT></FONT>

his position, in the distance were the dead bodies of the students.
They no longer produced a flame of aura, but a little leftover

death. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back where the
others were, just by the mountainside wall. Their teacher Del and a
few of the other students were deciding what to do. Del had called
over the main helpers, and the highest rank students for their
advice. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In Del's class,
there weren't many strong students. There were a couple of level 6
students and a few level 5 but that was it for the class. Vorden was
considered one of the strongest students despite his level, but he
had not been invited to the group meeting that Del was hosting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

still bore a grudge against Vorden, and after what Quinn had said, he
now hated their whole group. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe we
should head back where the beast came out from?&quot; A student
suggested. &quot;If we follow the trail of broken down trees then
maybe we can find our way back.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That won't
work,&quot; Del replied. &quot;The jungle is large and if that beast
lives here then there are likely to be many trees and paths that have
been created by the beasts and those similar to it. If we follow one
of those paths we might even be walking ourselves to be dinner for
another beast.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, you
suggest something.&quot; Another student said, their tone sharp,
rather annoyed at the situation. Even they felt like so far Del had
been useless at everything. Still, Del was a higher rank than them,
not just as a teacher but in the military as well, and they needed to
show him some respect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could also be the
deciding factor in their grades. So the students bit down their
tongues and moved on. But that didn't change the fact of how useless
he had been. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we
should go up one of the side paths of the mountain,&quot; Del
suggested. &quot;If we go up high then we can see the jungle from
above. We should be able to see where the area we started from was,
and if we can't see that, we will definitely be able to spot the
shelter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

in one place isn't a good idea. Look at their faces. Now they are
moving, and it is making them forget about what happened. They might

towards our goal.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The decision about
which side of the mountain they wanted to track up was inconclusive
as half the students wanted to go up one side, while the other half
wanted to go up the other side. They discussed the option of doing
just that, sending half the group up each side of the mountain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But after seeing how
effective they were as a single unit against a powerful beast, they
felt that it was best to keep everyone together in one powerful

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So eventually, they
started to travel up on the left side of the mountain. Del had made
the final decision and was ordering the group around. But curiously
he wasn't the one that was leading at the front of the group, instead
some of the stronger teams had their own individual front liner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del had made some
type of excuse claiming that he was the only one able to use the

no way to find them. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sergeants didn't
have a clue where Del's class was. They only knew that they had sent
out a distress signal, and knew the location that call was made from,

initial point of the distress call. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The scanners had
been turned on again. They would still record points and work as long
as they were within a 200-meter radius of Del. Even though the
scanners still provided each student with points for their team.
There was no fierce competition anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the primary

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If they came across
another beast and it was too powerful for their group to handle, Del

of the shelter. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Depending which
direction Del had lead them from the camp, the only way for them to
see the shelter or where they once came from was to climb to a high
enough point, so they could see the area around them in a bird's eye

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the slightly
inclined ground they were on looked like it could go on for miles and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Chaos had erupted on
the side slope of the mountain. Once the raindrops touched the top of
the beasts' head. It had sent them a signal informing them to rise to

knew Quinn and Fex weren't close enough, but obviously from Fex's
words. He was genuinely concerned about Quinn. But the question was,
when did the two of them become so close? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Fex could tell
the seriousness of the situation. He was the only one along with
Quinn that hadn't done much during the fight against the advanced

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe jumping
straight forward wasn't such a good idea.&quot; The pain wreaking

coming towards him across the floor with its mouth wide open. </FONT></FONT>

to consume would go straight down. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think so,&quot;
Del replied. &quot;I think these beasts reacted to the rain. They
seemed to appear and disappear at the same time as the rain appeared
and vanished... Luckily for us, in a place like this, the downpour

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del looked around,
and he could see there wasn't much blood. Also, during his studies,
he discovered that plant-type beasts mostly weren't carnivores. The

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last thing Quinn
could remember was Layla shouting out his name. Then, in a blink of
an eye⁠— they were swallowed whole. What came afterwards was
darkness. His body was continuously being swirled around, throwing
him off balance and it gave him not even a moment to balance himself
nor use any of his abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything was
happening so quickly but during the whole process, he didn't feel any
pain. Then when he had finally reached the bottom, Quinn felt his
body continuously sinking. It felt like he had been dropped in a
watery quagmire. He tried moving his hands using all the strength he
could muster but it seemed to have no effect. If anything⁠— it
was making him sink quicker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His legs were the
first thing to pass through and as it did, he felt a free range of
motion. They weren't hitting or placed against anything, but they
felt like he was in mid-air kicking them backwards and forwards.
Still, he was unable to feel anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'If the plant
swallowed me and now, I'm falling down, doesn't that mean I'm falling
into another part of the mountain, or underneath the planet?' Quinn
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The height of his
fall worried him the most. His arms had now gone through the strange
substance and now only the top of his head remained. Just like with
his legs his hands were able to move freely. But now, he started
worrying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn was right,
then once his head fell through his whole body would be falling. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was strong and he
had a sturdy body as a vampire, but what was he falling into? Lava,
spikes? Or into a pit of beasts? His abilities couldn't possibly save
him from that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's mind madly
spun as he thought about his next course of action. He activated his
shadow ability and covered his body thinly. It seemed to have worked
and slowed down the sinking process. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The space was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The force and Fex's

bit of strange substance. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn's body
floated through the air, he thought back to how the last thing he
ever saw might have just been Fex's backside knocking him down, as he
fell to his death. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That arse!&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking around
him, even though he was in the dark, his pupils widened enough,
letting in more light. He could see nearly just as well as outside.
His guess seemed right and he was really falling from the ceiling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The good news was
there didn't seem to be anything below that would do much damage, the
bad news was he was falling from about twenty meters in height and
the ground was coming closer to him as the seconds went by. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All he could do was
brace himself for impact, as he curled up into a ball. At the same
time, a shield of shadow was created in front of him. The shadow was
the first part to touch the ground and Quinn followed shortly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shadow had
slowed down the momentum of his fall and Quinn went inside and fused
with the shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You really are
useful,&quot; Quinn said as he took the shadow away but in that
moment. The speed had returned, and Quinn's body was slammed into the
ground just as hard as he would have done if he hadn't used the
shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In his haste, Quinn
had forgotten that the shadow didn't actually slow things down, but
only slowed down the time while he was touching the shadow. Once he
travelled through the shadow, or once it was taken away, the object
would continue to travel at the speed it previously had before
passing through the shadow or being one with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Covered in rubble
from the walls of the cave, Quinn stood up and discovered that not a
lot of damage was done to him. He felt sore in all sorts of places,
but his body was sturdier than before. It also didn't seem like any
of his bones had been broken from the fall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, he could
see Fex falling through the sky nearly at the exact same spot. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still remembering

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex looked around

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Stepping to the side

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike Quinn, Fex
immediately stood to his feet after crashing, rubbing the back of his
neck. &quot;You could have at least caught me man, what was that all
about?&quot; Fex continued to dust himself off and then looked around
at where they were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They seemed to be in
a large cavern that was completely empty. There were several large
holes or tunnels that seemed to lead to different paths. When looking
above them, They could see the plant hanging from the ceiling that
had swallowed them whole. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex started to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh no, my

Fex said angrily. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you want
the one you gave to me?&quot; Quinn offered. After all, it was never
his in the first place and he still had his blood bank to rely on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I can't,&quot;
Fex replied. &quot;I know I'm not big on rules and stuff but that was
a gift and I can't take back gifts. Besides, my reliance on blood is
a lot less than most people. It is already at that of a vampire
Noble. Don't worry about me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was true that Fex
never seemed to be as interested in blood as Quinn did. Even when a
student would bleed slightly Quinn would get this tingling feeling
all over his body and his eyes would naturally be drawn to the
bloodied area⁠— but Fex never felt the same way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Over at different

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do we do
now?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two students,
Vorden and Layla, were now stuck together in the cavern. Around them
multiple paths but with no way to tell which ones led up or down.
Seeing this, Layla didn't really have an idea about what to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now you're
speaking to me,&quot; Logan said. &quot;I thought it was my fault
that the two of us are done here, but when it comes to trying to find
a way out suddenly, you come to me for help.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla stomped her
foot, onto the ground and took a few steps away. She wanted to storm
off and just head down one of the paths randomly. But after only
taking a few steps, her hands started to shake, and her legs were
slowly banging into each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The thought of
seeing beasts like the ones they had seen so far being down here
frightened her. When she was training at Pure, their main goal wasn't
facing against beasts, but humans. As an agent, her tasks and
training dealt with infiltration, sabotage and a plethora of other
skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, no amount
of training could prepare a child for the real thing. Since coming to
this school she had seen more death then she would have liked, and it
was starting to take a toll on her body and mind, more so now that
her friend she would often comfort in, had gone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why are you
still having a go at me.&quot; Layla snapped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I told you
before, you're useless. You were useless before and even more so now.
At least back then you were Quinn's blood bank, but right now I can
fill that role. So honestly what use is there for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stop saying
the same thing over and over again!&quot; Layla was at breaking point
and had enough. She no longer wanted to take this type of abuse from
Vorden. Without thinking clearly, she lifted up a nearby rock and
swung it towards Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was an unexpected
attack from Layla, so Vorden was late in his reactions and managed to
dodge the small fist-size rock. Slightly the rock crazed his cheek.
It caused a surface cut, revealing a trickle of blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the first
attack didn't stop there. Layla continued to lift up the rocks around
and swung them towards Vorden. As they were hurled towards him,
Vorden did the same, repelling them away using the same ability but
also making sure not to throw attacks back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She continued
forward, screaming at the top of her lungs, the sound echoed through
the cavern. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wow!&quot;
Raten said, laughing. &quot;It looks like you finally broke her, I
mean I thought I was the cruel one. You really know how to annoy
someone when you want to. At least I just give them a beating, but
this Vorden. This is just pure evil.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden knew Raten
was just trying to annoy him by being sarcastic, the problem was it
was working. Had Vorden really gone too far? At this point, he had
been trying to split Layla and Quinn apart. Still, without saying too
much directly to Layla, rather than it being for himself or Quinn, he
was doing it for her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
���<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What's that
noise?&quot; Sil said as he stood up from his usual crouched
position. The screams from Layla seemed to be so loud that they had
even reached Sil who would usually ignore most things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Vorden was
too distracted deflecting the projectiles coming towards him to give
Sil a reply. As Sil started walking over towards the chair, Raten
smiled and stepped to the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now this will
be good to see.&quot; He said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sil placed his hand
on Vorden's shoulder, who was in the chair. Now they both had access
to what was going on outside. Sil could see and feel what Vorden was
doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
you need some help, swap with me,&quot; Sil said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sil, I can
handle it,&quot; Vorden replied carefully. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Swap with
me..&quot;Sil said, his grip tightening on Vorden's shoulder. Knowing
that he had no choice Vorden reluctantly left the seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back outside, four
stones were now being directed towards Vorden's body. So far he had
been taking a step back deflecting them as they came at him but
suddenly. He stood there completely still. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he raised his
hands, all of the stones stopped mid-air for a moment. Then at the
same time, the four stones were repelled away with even greater
force. Layla could tell just from the sound they had made when
hitting the walls around him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why are you
attacking me?&quot; Sil asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had noticed
the sudden change in Vorden's attitude, she had even seen this happen
a few times before. At the canteen, while they were fighting in the
desert and now again. Her sudden attack's had stopped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you are
trying to hurt me, then you are against me,&quot; Sil said as he
lifted both hands and used an incredible force to push Layla's body
back. Right now, Sil was combining the MC points in Cia's level four
ability along with Layla's level 2 ability. His telekinesis powers
were that of a level 6. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no chance
at Layla stopping the power. The next moment she was flung against
the wall. The back of her head swung back into a piece of rock, and
her vision quickly went to black as she passed out on the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The problem
has been dealt with,&quot; Sil said with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In another part of
the cavern, two more students seemed to be stuck together dealing
with their own problems. Cia was taken aback at the sight of Peter's
legs all mangled. They had utterly broken and it looked like part of
the bone had splintered through parts of the skin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She turned her head
away, unable to look at the sight any longer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stay here, I
will go look for help,&quot; Cia said in a panic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know, if
you didn't hold onto me, the fall wouldn't have been as bad,&quot;
Peter replied in a calm voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia found it strange
that it seemed like Peter wasn't affected by this whole ordeal, but
she couldn't bear to look at him. Instead, she started to look around
the area to see if there was anything she could find. Just like the
caverns, the others were stuck in. There were multiple holes and
paths to choose from. Not knowing which way was out or would lead
them to the surface. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia walked up to the
entrances, which were a little away from where they had landed. She
wanted to see if she could hear anything coming from down the
tunnels. Perhaps some would be filled by beasts, but the others had
also been swallowed, and just maybe they weren't too far from them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She tilted her head,
with her ear faced forward towards the entrance, seeing if she could
hear the slightest sound. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we
should go this way.&quot; A voice said stood right behind her. Cia
was startled, and out of instinct, she turned and threw her fist,
hitting Peter right in the Jaw, before taking a few steps to the
side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It hadn't hurt
Peter, but only slightly moved his head to the side but a small mark
could also be seen across his cheek. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Pio, but how?
Your legs were all mangled just a few seconds ago.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Apologize
now!&quot; Peter demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What for the
punch?&quot; Cia asked. &quot;No way, how the hell is that my fault.
You snuck up on me when I thought you couldn't move, in a dark and
creepy cave with possible beasts. Anyone's reaction would have been
the same.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Still, should
you not apologize if you hit someone? Or am I mistaken.&quot; Said,
Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're weird,
why did I have to get stuck with you. I think you should be a bit
nicer to me. After all, if we run into anything down here. Then we
will be relying on my ability a lot more than yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia still didn't
know Peter's ability, but she had a guess. His watch indicated he was
a level four, and if he managed to recover from an injury like that,
most likely his ability was a healing one or a regenerative one. The
only thing she couldn't quite put her finger on was the healing
speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She had never met a
healer or seen a regenerative ability that could allow someone to
recover that fast. They would be at level eight to do such a thing.
Still, this meant it was clear his ability wasn't a combat one. While
Cia's wasn't either. She was sure of her hand to hand combat skills
over the frail and weak Pio. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she took a step
forward, hoping to head to the other side of the cave where the other
entrances were. Peter suddenly blocked her path. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Wasn't he at least
five meters away, how did he get here so fast?' She thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you don't
apologize to me and you are going to have a problem, a serious
problem.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whatever!&quot;
Cia said as she tried to walk past Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this moment, she
felt something grasp around her throat, when she looked down, she
could see a hand, and it was linked to Pio. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What...are..you

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, footsteps
could be heard coming from one of the tunnels. It was unclear which
one, as the echo made it hard to pinpoint the sound. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now Pio, I

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the short haired
boy entered the room, not only did Peter recognize him but it seemed
like Cia did too. For some reason at the sight of the boy Peter's
grip around Cia's neck had loosened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this moment she
took the opportunity to try to knock Peter's hand away using her full
force slamming it against Peter's forearm, but in doing so she
realised it had the same effect as moving a rock that weighted a ton.
There seemed to be no effect or movement. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think it
will be best if you put her down Pio, annoying as she may be it might
cause us more problems in the future.&quot; Logan said as he took a
final bite of his sandwich. &quot;Him that was the last one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment,
Logan didn't look like his regular self. Apart from his head that was
fully showing Logan had his full body suit on from the neck down. Due
to him not knowing what he might meet down here he was always
prepared for the worst. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, Logan's was
quite popular around the school even if he didn't know it himself.
The few appearances he made on the last outing and during the
school's events every once in a while had really caught the attention
of other students, this of course included Cia. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Cia was
wondering what the connection between Logan and Pio was, right now
she just wanted to get away from Pio. Using her ability she stabbed a
spear into Peter's belly. Not just one but three. Due to how close
she was to him she was able to stick in multiple spears one after the
other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the first one
had entered Peter's body his movements were slowed allowing her to
put in two more. Once again, using all her force she tried to whack
Peter's hand away. Still, it felt like she was pounding her hand
against solid rock, but this time with the help of her ability
weakening Peter. Her attack was a success and managed to knock his
hand away and broke free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not knowing where to
run to, she decided to head down one of the many tunnels. If another
student had arrived and had no relation to the person named Pio. Then
maybe she would have bolted towards Logan, but seeing that the two of
them had some type of a relationship she didn't want to risk it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The cave was dark
and it was hard for her to see, but each of the tunnels gave off a
little reflection of light. what she didn't know. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was always the
chance that the small amount of light could be radiating from a
beast, or it could just be a raw crystal. Because of this, as Cia ran
she needed to be carful about her footing. Not being able to see
where or what she was taking steps into. It was a cave and they were
deep underground. With the floors being uneven and travelling in the
dark, Cis was being naturally cautious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is a
pain, i wish i bought some type of light with me or something!&quot;
Cia complained. The group did have emergency equipment and rations
such as tourches and so on, but they were all kept with Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Taking another step
forward her foot seemed to be lodged between something. She quickly
managed to pull it but it had greatly slowed her down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is such a
pian in the arse, whatever i have to deal with though he will to.&quot;
Cia thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why did you
chose to run.&quot; Logan said. &quot;3...2….1.&quot; As logan
finished counting down, peter was already directly in front of Cia.
Somehow the difficult pathway that she had taken was easily navigated
by him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no touch
in his hand, no light source. So just how did Peter manage to catch
up with her so fast? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, decided to
wait until the spirit spears had disappeared before chasing Cia. Not
only that, but just like Quinn. Peter also had the advantage of
seeing in the dark. For him it was as if the cave was lit up so he
had no problem deciding on the quickest path to take just when he
found her he heard Logan Shouting &quot;Pio!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Peter turned
around he could see Logan holding his hand out. But on the end of his
hand was a rounded and strange bright green light getting larger as
the moment went on, It was Logan's hand blaster and Peter had seen
what it could do before when it was fired against Fex. Someone who is
stronger then both him and Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Perhaps, even his
regeneration abilities wouldn't be able to keep up with this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You stop
running will you.&quot; Logan complained while looking at cia. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the blaster
was held against Peter he decided to let the thing go. He wasn't
stupid and could always find a way to get to Cia later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
doing down here?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, Cia
was unsure of what to do, the entrance to another tunnel wasn't to
far away, but it seemed like Logan was able to control Peter just
like Quinn could somehow. She still didn't understand how Peter
managed to catch up to her so fast, so her only option was to stay by
Logan's side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She scuttled along
around the side until she was eventually behind Logan. Logan then
tapped something on the side of his suit, which brightened up the
area around him with green lights. The pieces on Logan's equipment
were illuminating a small 5 meter radius around them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I adjusted the
scanner the school gave us to increase its radius. I had to power it
with my own beast crystals and don't get any points for doing that
but to me it was well worth it.&quot; Said Logan. &quot;That's when i
discovered that there seemed to be strange tunnels underground but
they didn't quite look natural so i decided to investigate. I never
thought anyone else would be down here. So it was a nice surprise to
see you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
the way out?&quot; cia asked. Realising form what Logan said he
should have a wide area mapped out using his scanner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No.&quot;
Logan replied. Although this was a lie. If he had told the truth he
knew they would ask to lead him out of here, but Logan had discovered
something on his scanner that he had to check out before leaving. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Somewhere inside the
large cave Fex and Quinn had decided to walk down one of the tunnels.
While inside the tunnel the connection between Peter seemed to be
lost. It had happened ever since he went underground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought that
it might have something to do with the distance between the two at
the moment, as he didn't know that Peter and the others were
underground as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking that help
would never arrive, they decided to just leave it up to fate and pick
the tunnel with the biggest entrance. As they walked down the tunnel
they noticed that the walls were surrounded with thin blue crystals
that gave off a slight glow to them. Not enough to light up the whole
area, but one could follow the small light source quite easily. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are
these?&quot; Quinn asked, looking at the small crystals. They
resembles something similar to beast crystals, but Quinn thought the
only way to obtain beast crystals was form killing a beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I really don't
know.&quot; fex replied. &quot;I was going to ask you the same
thing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The curiosity had
gotten the better of him and Quinn decided to place his hand on top
of the crystal. At first he was planning to use his inspect skill but
there was no need for the system had automatically given him a
message. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Would you like to
store in your system?] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shock from the
message was quite immense. At school they had been taught that the
beast crystals could only be obtained from beasts. This was why the
human race had been sending hunting parties to slay the beasts. Even
though there was the chance of death. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There's crystals
could be used to create powerful weapons and even power their modern
equipment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But right here,
crystals were just forming on the wall around him, and it wasn't just
one crystal. There seemed to be hundreds of crystals, through the
tunnel they had just walked. If Quinn was to think about all the
other tunnels as well there would at least be thousands down here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Fex keeping an
eye over his back, Quinn was unable to store it in his system however
he did pull the crystal out and placed it in his trouser pocket for
later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It might be
something important.&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex just shrugged
his shoulders uninterested by the small crystal and carried on
walking ahead. FInally they had reached the end of the tunnel. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys froze
for a moment once they exited from the tunnel. Looking at what lay in
front of their eyes, they paused for a moment. Somehow it didn't feel
like they were actually really underground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, can you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you're

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Exiting from the
tunnel, it seemed like they'd arrived at what looked like a type of
town. It was impossible for them to measure how large the entire
place was. Buildings stretched out far and wide and it was comparably
as large as any one of the shelters they've seen before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If they were to give
a rough estimate, it looked like a few thousand people used to live
in such an establishment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ceiling seemed
to be unreachable. Although they could see the peak, it felt like
there was no way to reach it. Their gaze moved on towards the tallest
building that stood in the centre of the place. It was a round tower
like structure that was tall and high, but it hardly touched the
ceiling. If one wished to even touch the ceiling, they would have to
build a similar size building and place it on top of the already
existing tower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although a town
underneath a mountain and town was surprising to them both it didn't
seem impossible. There were rumors of such shelters being built on
other planets where the temperatures could reach extreme levels at
different times of year, underground shelters were the only answer to
such uninhabitable places. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And so the reason
why both of them were shocked was for a different reason entirely.
The two of them could already observe that the design and materials
used to create the buildings were different. One of the main features
was the solid black material that it was made from. Instead of brick,
cement or metal it was a different kind, a special black substance
that was more stable and stronger was the primary material of all the
buildings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The substance was
said to be just as strong as galthreium. Although the place looked
abandoned and was void of people, the buildings were a different
matter. The structures themselves looked perfectly fine and hadn't
deteriorated a single bit. The only semblance of passage of time of
abandonment was a layer of dust or rock like substance from the
ceiling that coated the top of everything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And finally the
design. Although the substance was strong it wasn't as flexible and
nimble as glathrium. This meant that the edges weren't smoothed out
giving everything that was made a slight rocky look. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After looking at the
buildings the two of them had both come to the conclusion that the
structures built in front of them were not made by humans. This was
the true reason why both of them were in shock. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They're Dalki
structures,&quot; Quinn muttered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was a huge
discovery. The humans had only built a shelter and classified the
place as an orange portal due to them thinking they had discovered
the planet first. There were rare cases like this when the two
opposition were trying to take control of a planet at the same time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the two groups
were to meet, regardless if there was a treaty signed or not, a fight
would break out until one side was completely annihilated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Fex heard these
words come out from Quinn's mouth though, there was confusion on his
face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Er, what are
you on about?&quot; Fex replied. &quot;These aren't Dalki structures.
There vampire structures.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing these words
equally shocked Quinn again. He was almost positive these were Dalki
structures. He had seen them in his lessons and on the news time and
time again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The boy is
right.&quot; the system replied. &quot;These resemble the structures
that were built in my time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system didn't
really answer any of the questions Quinn had right now and only
confused him even more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex, have you
ever seen Dalki structures?&quot; Quinn asked. There was one
possibilty Quinn thought. Perhaps the two structures were similar and
Quinn himself was being confused. Maybe there was something that he
couldn't spot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually no,
I'll be honest, maybe you know more about the Dalki because you live
on earth but we don't even really get taught about them. I've never
seen a Dalki either, only heard them being mentioned form time to
time by one of the elders.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From Fex's answer
there seemed to be a couple of possibilities. The fact that the Dalki
and vampires use the same material, perhaps their technologies are on
par with each other and it would make sense why their structures
looked similar. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The strange black
substance, the humans were never able to figure out just how to use
it properly, so they stuck to using Glathreium over it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other
possibility was somehow the Dalki and vampires were linked together,
but this seemed even more farfetched, especially since Fex didn't
even really know what a Dalki was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, do you
know why the vampire and Dalki structures look so similar?&quot;
Quinn asked, hoping to find an answer. &quot;Also, if it is a vampire
structure why did they build one here underground?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They do? Well,
that's strange. I'll be honest I'm not the best person to ask. When
it comes to vampires I'm really young. I'm sure the elders or others
will know the answer to your question or maybe even a better student,
I never paid attention in class.&quot; Fex said laughing nervously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For your
second question i really don't know either, it looks like this place
has been here a while, maybe it was one of the planets the vampires
used before, moving to another. It would make sense why it was built
underground in the first place as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about
you, system, did the Dalki exist during your time?&quot; Quinn asked
in his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The Dalki did
not exist while I was still active.&quot; the system replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn made a small
note in his head about how the system replied. It seemed the choice
of words it had used was oddly specific but he knew if he pressed
further, the system would just give his usual resistance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There is one
thing we can do?&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Why don't we check out some
of the buildings, maybe there will be something inside which will
tell us if it was the Dalki's who made this or the Vampires. I'm
especially interested to see what they would have in that tower
structure.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, it looks
like you read my mind.&quot; Fex replied with a chuckle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
started to walk through the strange building structures, and the more
they started to walk the more it looked like a town to the both of
them. There were streets with buildings lined up on both sides. If
you followed the streets far enough it would eventually lead them to
one of the tunnels they had come through. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking around
at the walls, it looked like there were several tunnels that lead to
the town. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them had
entered some of the first few houses, but they seemed to be void on
any items whatsoever. There weren't even beds inside, but it was
clear they were normal family structures. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn entered the
place he could imagine a family living here, with all the different
rooms, but while looking at the place he just wondered what happened
here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They entered a few
more buildings on their way but still there seemed to find nothing.
Eventually they decided to no longer enter the small buildings as it
seemed to be a waste of time. If they were going to find anything, it
would be in the tower structure near the middle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time,
as they got closer to the tower, it looked like some of the buildings
had been destroyed. As if they had taken part in a battle. The top of
them had crumbled to the ground and some structures no longer
existed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this caused
Fex to worry a little. He knew how tough the material was and if
something was able to destroy that they needed to have some level of
strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued to
walk down the street. They still had some distance to go, but the
tower could be seen directly in front of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, the sound
of growling could be heard coming from the sides. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where is that
sound coming from?&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They could both hear
the growling clearly but it seemed like they were several of them and
if he was right they were currently surrounded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess it's
time to call on some extra help.&quot; Fex touched his ear and pulled
on his dangling earring. Suddenly in the palm of his hand the earring
started to glow until eventually, it started to change its shape
forming what looked like a cross between a bull and bat. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't a hard

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While traveling,

town and although it came as a surprise to the other two, Logan had
already expected this. It was exactly what had come up on the

he needed to visit this place. How could he pass the opportunity to
do some research on some Dalki architecture. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The blue crystal
seemed to be randomly scattered through the city. Lighting up certain

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The one place that

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Relax.&quot;
Logan replied. &quot;Although my scanner doesn't work down here, when

civilization living here. Although their were other things.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without saying
anything to the others, Logan started to walk down the path onto the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking at
their backs, Cia couldn't help but think they were crazy. However, as
Logan walked away so did the light source that was surrounding her.
The darkness around started to creep in, it felt almost suffocating
and she couldn't help but think something was watching her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What was that!' Cia
thought as she quickly turned her head towards the noise. Although

certain direction could be heard. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After checking a few
buildings, Logan had come to the conclusion that there was nothing of
worth from the buildings around him. However, when using his scanner
from above he was able to see all of the building structures and
things around it, but the he was unable to see what was inside the
tower. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This of course, just

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When scanning
this area earlier I found that the beasts seemed to be concatenated
around the tower. Strange right? Low level beasts don't usually have
a form of high intelligence, they hunt sleep and eat. Sometimes they
do this in packs and might have a type of territory, but this seems
oddly specific. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In a place as large
as this, and with many beasts, usually they would be several
territories and maybe several packs. So why are they all centered
around the tower? As if they were guarding it, or gathering around it
for some reason.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia had disregarded
most of what Logan had said, the only thing she had heard was they

the side into one of the buildings. This sudden movement was even a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had gone into the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without hesitation,
both Logan and Cia started to attack the dogs. She threw out spears,

were not made from beast gear. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon they realized,
there wasn't much for Peter and Cia to do. Peter had manged to defeat
a couple more, but Logan would blast most of them away before they
even got close. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, the
beasts stopped leaping through the air, and Logan stopped using his
blasters. There was a limited supply of energy and if they stopped
attacking then Logan would do the same. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, something
strange was occurring. They had manged to kill around thirty
different dogs in total. Both Peter and Logan could see that there
was still plenty around them. Still, they didn't run away but stood
there at the edge of the street next to the buildings, growling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why aren't
they attacking?&quot; Cia asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That is
something I would like to know the answer to as well.&quot; Logan
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On closer
inspection, it seemed like the dogs were no longer looking at them,
instead they were facing the the street, looking out towards the
tower in front of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There
shaking.&quot; Peter said. &quot;The beasts, I can tell they're
scared.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From the street, the
sounds of footsteps could be heard. Whatever was coming towards them
was frightening the beasts even more. Because with each footstep, it
looked like the beasts were pulling back slightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even Logan, a level

same effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally the figure
was starting to come into view. From out of the shadow a dark outline
could be seen, It had a human outline shape but it was still hard to
make out. Still, Logan was sure on one thins, it was clear it wasn't
human... it was a beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time
during the drip, Logan started to sweat heavily in his suit. If a
beast had a humanoid figure it meant one thing. The opponent they
were about to face, was at least at the king tier. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After collecting the
beast crystals from the defeated hounds, Quinn had suddenly recived
the message about obtaining exp. He had figured out that the exp he
just gained must have been from Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the only
thing that made sense, and would also explain why the system had used
the word &quot;Share&quot;. This meant one thing. That Peter was
close. He didn't know how or why Peter was down here as well, but if
he had to guess Peter probably chose to come down here to follow him.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was strange
though, even though the system was able to pick up the exp points
from Peter. Quinn was still unable to sense Peter's presence like he
could when he was above ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;
Fex asked as he could see it looked like Quinn was deep in thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wanted to go
searching for Peter. He didn't know how far away he needed to be for
the system to pick up the exp, but the fact that he even got
experience points in the first place, meant right now he was fighting
other beasts. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think I
might have spotted a strange looking building over in that
direction.&quot; Said Quinn. &quot;Do you mind if we check it out
first before going to the tower?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex shrugged his
shoulders and replied. &quot;Hey, it's not like we know how to get
out of this place anyway.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both of thier
eyesights were as good as each other. Nearly all vampires could see
as well. The only thing that improved as they grew stronger where
thier senses. Perhaps a stronger vampire would be able to sense
energy in a specific direction, but in terms of how far or well they
could see in the dark, it was near all the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking in the
direction that Quinn had pointed to, Fex could see nothing that
looked out of the ordinary. Still, Fex he was curious why the sudden
change in direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they were closer
to the tower, the area around it wasn't as wide. If Quinn was to go
in a circle, perhaps he would be able to spot them. Without his
senses, there was no way to tell which direction to go in. As Quinn
was thinking about it, another message appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The message just
confirmed that Peter was still in combat. Peter was strong, but if he
was surrounded by multiple basic tier beasts like they were just
moments ago, he wouldn't get out of it unscratched. Even with his
super healing. It would mean he would eventually have to consume
human flesh once again. So Quinn picked a random direction and headed
off. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Slowly, Layla's eyes
started to open, her vision was blurry at first but what stood out to
her was the pain on the back of her head. She instinctively placed
her hand, and the stinging was worse. When looking at her hand, dried
particles of blood had rubbed off onto it. It was hard to see in the
dark, but she knew from the feeling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she looked up,
her vision had returned, and she could see the person who had done
put her in this situation, standing right next to her. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Get away from
me!&quot; Layla said in a panic. She pushed her feat of the floor
against her, and once again, her head had banged into the wall. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden did as asked
and slowly backed away, seeing that she was panicked. She had already
been hurt, and Vorden didn't want to cause any more pain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Calm down, I'm

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of sobbing
could be heard, Layla had planted her head between her knees and let
out all the emotions away. &quot;Why are you only like this to me?&quot;
She cried. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing Layla like
this, Vorden felt ache and pain in his heart. He never wanted her to
get hurt. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm...Sorry.&quot;

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sobbing started
to stop, and Layla began to get a grip on her emotions. It seemed
like Vorden was back to his usual self. The air around him that she
noticed in the past was no longer there. But she knew it could flick
like a switch. It was as if he was bipolar. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing that Vorden
was okay now, and not wanting to step on his toes, she thought maybe
she could find out the reason. It wasn't normal to be like this, and
at the Pure base, she had seen cases similar to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was going to be
hard for her. Her hands couldn't stop trembling, as someone far more
powerful then she stood right in front of her. A wrong move or a word
could end her life, and she really felt like it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden are you
okay, sometimes it seems like, you suddenly change. I want to belive
you when you say you don't mean to hurt me. But when I end up like
this.&quot; As Layla spoke, her voice was shaky, she tried her best
to hide it, but Vorden could feel the fear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lately, the changes
happening to Vorden had become more frequent. In the past, he
remained in control most of the time, but thier were plenty of times
recently where he needed to rely on the others for help. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And now for the
first time in a while, Sil was actively asking for a seat. As these
changes happened, it was expected that people would start to notice.
The worst thought in his mind was the possibility of one of the
others taking control of the seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They didn't have the
social skills that Vorden possessed to keep up his image. If they
took over, he wouldn't know what to do. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When I first
met Quinn, I knew he was different,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;Perhaps,
for the same reasons you were attracted to him, I was too. He was
plain, a level one user, but had this look in his eyes that said he
still had fight in him, not like the others. Of course, at the time,
I didn't know he was a vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;In my old
school, there were quite a few Quinn's. They were the same, they
still had hope, still had fight in them, but eventually, they were
broken down and beaten, submitted to the system just like everyone
else. It was rare to see someone make it into military school without
already being broken. You could even see it with Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I was sick of
it, sick of everything and decided if I could at least save one
person, it would be enough for me. Maybe I could show Quinn that even
as a level one user, not everyone treated you the same, and you could
make it through in the world. Then I got wrapped up in all this
vampire business.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a good
explanation, and Layla could tell thier was some truth behind
Vorden's words, but she could also tell that he was missing out some
key points and details. The question was, why though? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What does that
have to do with me though, can't we both get along with Quinn?&quot;
Layla asked. &quot;Are you jealous or something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not me...&quot;
Vorden mumbled, too quiet for Layla to here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I haven't
exactly had the best of experiences since coming here,&quot; Vorden
replied. &quot;I was tied up and beaten by the second years, shoved
to a red portal planet, and now stuck down here. I think it's normal
to be a bit unstable after what we have been through.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden finished
what he was saying, he took a step forward. Layla reacted by
shuffling her Knees closer towards herself, curling into a ball. The
sight of this reminded him of Sil, and in a sweet calming voice, he
did what he usually did without thinking about it... Vorden started
to sing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It will be
okay, I will make your worries go away...I am by your side... I will
always be kind.&quot; As she listened to the soft angelic voice,
without realising it, Vorden was already next to her once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her hands had

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden started to

down.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He gently lifted his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the first
time that Logan had ever felt panic. Due to him having night vision
in his helmet he was wearing, he was able to see the beast before it
came into view. Peter could as well but was unaware of the magnitude
of horror they were about the face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Perhaps Peter didn't
study as well at school and thought it was just a regular beast, or
when he had evolved everything about him changed. Right now it didn't
look like he could feel fear like the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Beasts were
separated into different tiers. The tiers were based on the crystals
that were embedded in their body. The more powerful the crystal, the
higher the tier of the beast. This, however, didn't always mean they
were stronger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Depending on the
beast's structure or abilities, sometimes in rare cases, there were
those that were more difficult to deal with. This was unlikely the
case because a higher tier beast would be able to draw more power
from the crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Basic tier,
intermediate tier, Advanced tier and right now, they were about to
face something that was at least at king tier level. There were
level's above this, including the highest level ever given, Demon
tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Throughout history,
whenever a beast that had a humanoid shape was discovered, they would
at least be at the king tier level or above. There were still beasts
that were at this level that didn't have a humanoid shape, but a
humanoid type beast has never been lower than a king tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Knowing that he
would need everyone's help. Logan immediately changed one of his
blasters' shapes slightly allowing it to be more narrow. The armour
shifted at a fantastic speed, and when it had finished transforming,
Logan quickly fired three blasts into the buildings around them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shots weren't
energy blasts like before. Instead, these were sticky light balls.
They allowed a considerable amount of light to be shown and would
easily stick onto whatever object they hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were two
reasons for Logan doing this, one was to allow them to see their
opponent more easily. If a creature came from the dark, their eyes
and senses should be adjusted to the environment down here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He needed to even
the playing field, and it would also allow Cia to help them. The
second reason was related to the first. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sticky lights
had been shot in a triangle formation around them. One to the left,
one to the right, and one slightly behind where the King tier beast
was standing. This lit up the entire street. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the dogs
couldn't see the strange light, they could feel it and were
frightened away. What Logan had also hoped for was that the light
source would hurt, or blind the king tier beast's sensitive eyes but
it seemed to have no effect, as it continued to walk forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is that
thing?&quot; Cia said, trembling. Now that there was a light source,
Cia could see what Logan could see, and she knew straight away the
danger of the beast. &quot;Should we run?&quot; She asked, looking
for an answer from Logan who seemed to be the only one acting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Run, there's

Peter said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this Logan
realised Peter was perhaps more aware of the situation then he had
thought. He just knew there was nothing they could do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast slowly
continued to walk towards the group, and by now all of the dogs in
the area had already scurried away. Now not only could the beast
outer shape be seen, but all of its details were in view. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although it had an
outer human shape, it was a bit on the larger end, it stood around
eight feet tall. Its body was twisted and strange as if it was made
of mud and rocks and at the top where it heads should be. The muscle
structure of the creature was outlined with plant roots. While the
rest just looked like a mound of mud. What was frightening about it
though, was in the upper mound part of its body. Several human
skeletons could be seen half sunken into ints body and half sticking
out. A skull, a rib cage and other parts as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was as if the
beast had been made from all the parts around it. Finally, on its
too-long arms, there were no fingers as such. Instead, they were long
and sharp like a blade. From the forearm downward, it looked like the
mud tree-like material changed into a harder substance. The blades
shined green in colour like a hard jade. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Cia, Pio!&quot;
Logan shouted. &quot;Buy me some time.&quot; Logan was unprepared to
meet something like this down here. He thought that if the school was
prepared to send some students to an orange portal planet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They would have at
least sent them to one, where only at most the advanced tier level
beasts had been reported to be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no point
attacking the beast with his current blasters; it would do nothing.
What Logan needed to do was get his most powerful weapon and suit on,
but it would take some time. His suit started to break down into the
little spiders. They were eventually all scattered on the floor. From
the ground up, they started to rebuild a different type of suit right
in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on faster
you guys,&quot; Logan said. &quot;I know you usually do your best,
but right now I need you more than ever.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The unconfirmed king
tier beast continued to slowly walk as if it was a king taking a
stroll through its own kingdom. Peter could see Logan's spiders
building something, and knew their best chance of survival right now
was relying on him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If they wanted to
live, They needed to do what was asked of them. Cia could see Peter
was about to move forward and shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, wait! The
thing still hasn't attacked us yet. Maybe if we don't attack it, it
will just continue walking past us.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter took a look at
the beast, it had now stopped walking forward and stood in the middle
of the street. It placed one of its bladed hands in front of the
other and scraped them against each other. A slight screeching sound
could be heard as the beast continued to do this process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No,' Peter
said. &quot;It already considers us intruders. It will continue to
attack us until we're gone. I can tell.&quot; With those words said,
Peter threw his bag on his back to the ground and dashed forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was at an
incredible speed that Peter had not displayed until this point, and
it was even a surprise to him. This was because Quinn had gotten
stronger, and in return. Peter's own stats had increased. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, Peter would
do his best to hide his abilities. The speed he was running at right
now was not possible for a human who wasn't wearing any beast gear or
didn't have any ability. But it wasn't the time to hide their powers,
it was a matter of life and death. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Cia was
frightened, she wasn't stupid. She too got into position, Dashing
towards one of the sides of the building. While doing so, she threw
out her spirit spears. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please hit!&quot;
She prayed. If the beast was indeed a king tier, then there wasn't
much chance that her spears would be able to hit her target. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the beast
continued to stand there and allowed the spears to be lodged into its
upper part of its body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it going
easy on us?&quot; She thought. At the same time, she wondered what
Peter was planning to do. He held no beast weapons and only had his
regenerative ability, he would be killed in a matter of moments. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Peter was in
range, the beast swung down its blade hand. Using all his strength,
Peter swung both his fists together like a tennis racket. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is it,&quot;
Cia said. &quot;No human has the strength to match a beast with their
bare hands.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the hands met
with the side of the blade, the power was surprisingly equal, the
blades were knocked away, but Peter hadn't budged. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is going

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast was
confused itself. When fighting it would purposely match its strength
based on the opponent in front of it. It was sure it had gauged Peter
well. What it didn't account for, was the spirit spears in its body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Making the
adjustment in its power, it swung it's blade faster and stronger with
its other hand. Peter was unable to do anything. All he could see now
was the dark black ceiling above. </FONT></FONT>

facing in a certain direction. It had chosen its next target. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was looking at
Logan... </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The suit's creation
was almost done. It was mostly silver in colour, matching that of the
spiders. Unlike the previous one which was quite large and bulky,
looking almost mech-light. This one suited Logan's body shape and
stature more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only the last part
remained which was the head. Logan saw the beast coming towards him
and decided to quickly place his body into the suit being made. He
planned on allowing the spiders to complete the final part. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the top of his
hands, were two circular rings. Around the edge of the rings were
small little metallic claws that looked similar to a tooth. &quot;It's
still not active.&quot; Said Logan looking at the circular rings,
&quot;the suit needs to be complete before I can do anything. Just a
few more seconds...&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Taking another step,
the beast suddenly felt something grabbing onto its leg. As it looked
down, it could see the opponent that it had already defeated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter continued to
grasp at the tree trunk like leg as hard as he could. Once again, the
beast looked down, this time when lifting up its arm, it started to
extend above its own head. Cia realized that she was indeed not
imagining things, the beast could retract and extend its limbs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast swung
downward, Cia squinted. She couldn't watch anymore. Still, she needed
to… </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When she opened her
eyes once again. Peter's arm had been removed from his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The suit of armour
had been completed. The suit was mostly silver in colour and the top
helmet part covering the head would be, was a single pane of glass
going from the chin up to the top of the head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The chest was plated
in a green metal, while the two circles on top of his hands were also
outlined in green. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This won't be
enough,&quot; Logan predicted after witnessing the fight between
Peter and the beast. He had seen Peter fight in the VR game and he
could gauge his strength. There was still one more thing Logan
needed. &quot;A weapon.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A strange square
like device was attached to Logan's belt. He chucked the strange
object on the floor and it suddenly expanded into what looked like a
large chest. Logan quickly grabbed some crystals from the chest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Otherwise
might think this is a waste, but our lives are on the line.&quot;
After taking out the crystals, the device returned to its original
size, and a robotic spider jumped up retuning it around his waist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After placing the
two crystals into the top part of his hand, the green like circles
started to glow. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Still needs
more time… Looks like it needs more time than I had previously
predicted. That or the worry inside me is making me feel like this is
taking forever.&quot; Logan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast was now
only a few meters away from Logan's position. The problem was, now
that he knew the beast was able to extend its limbs, it was hard for
him to gauge its true attack range distance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After analysing his
opponent Logan felt like this suit was the best against it, but he
was beginning to have second thoughts whether or not he had chosen
the right decision. The suit he used most of the time was equally
balanced when it came, to power, defence and speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The suit he had
formed now focused on attack power. After seeing what the creature
looked like he thought it was the best option. With a small body
frame and arms for weapons, he wanted to fight fire with fire.
However, now that he knew it had some range. Perhaps something
speed-oriented would have been better. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other problem
was, the suit was pretty useless when it came to defence, and right
now his weapon hadn't even finished forming. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Logan was
planning to make a dash for it, a familiar voice shouted from behind
the beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, if you
want to forget about me, you have to make sure you've killed me
first!&quot; Peter shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Cia turned her
head to look at who was shouting, she was amazed. She rubbed her eyes
a few times just to make sure she wasn't hallucinating. It was Pio.
He was standing on his two feet, and his arm had been reached. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She knew he had
impressive regenerative abilities, but this was something out of this
world. Inhuman almost. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter stood
there, she noticed he had his hand over his belly. His regenerative
powers were impressive, but he had used too much energy and for the
first time, he felt hungry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started having
second thoughts that if he was to get this severely injured once
more, then maybe he wouldn't be able to regenerate anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast turned and
looked at Peter, tilting its body slightly to the side. It seemed
confused. Its interest had been piqued and once again he started to
walk towards Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Peter had
regenerated, he hadn't suddenly gotten stronger. If he was to face
the creature again it would just be the same outcome. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter saw it
heading towards him he was trying to decide what to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Should I go
for its legs? But it's too fast. Maybe I should run and attack. Just
because its attack speed is fast doesn't mean its legs are fast.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as Peter
had finished that thought, the roots in its legs contracted, then
pushed off the ground, propelling it forward like some type of
spring. It was now directly in Peter's face in a matter of seconds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It swung its arm out
and Peter could see the blade. With his reaction speed, he was able
to react to the attack, but he could tell that he was just a little
too late and the blade this time would chop his head off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If only I was
a little bit faster!&quot; Peter shouted. </FONT></FONT>

down with all his might, and as he did, the sound of an object
swinging fast through the air was heard. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at the
beast's body, Spirit spears could be seen plunging deep inside of it.
Cia who had been watching from the side was deeply confused. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She looked closely
at the spears that were inside the beast. They looked identical to
her own, the only problem was, she wasn't the one who had thrown
them. Those spirit spears hadn't come from her, which meant it could
have only come from one person. </FONT></FONT>
