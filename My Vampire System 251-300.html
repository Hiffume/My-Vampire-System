<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this message
had brought back bad memories for Quinn. No longer did Peter need to
be fed. The only situation where he did was if he had been too

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn no longer got
the exp shared message and he started to fear the worst. Him and Fex
had been walking around in a circle like area and had covered almost
half of the distance while walking around. It seemed like luck wasn't

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were too far
in, around one direction. If they were to turn around and head back
it would only take longer. But with worry inside him for what was
happening, he started to pick up the pace. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the first
attack on Peter, the beast stood there slightly confused not
following up with a second attack. Using this opportunity, he quickly
picked and shifted over and backed away from the creature. It didn't
seem interested in following him, but this time, with the spears that
were stuck inside it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While doing this he
chose to head in the opposite direction of Vorden and Layla. They
were both using long-range skills, and it wouldn't be good if the
beast got close to them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When coming from the
side of one of the buildings, the two of them had quickly assessed
the situation. Seeing a humanoid creature they knew the others were
in danger, and when they saw Peter trying to confront the thing, they
didn't have much time to think and needed to act straight away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla go check
up on Logan and see if there's anything you can do to help,&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;It looks like Logan is preparing something and
right now, he's the strongest one here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden still had not
gotten the chance to gather much abilities. If he were to gauge
himself, he was at one of his weakest moments right now. Cia's
support ability was at level 4 and Layla's telekinesis ability was at
level 2. Using Raten he could power that up to level 6.
Unfortunately, there was no way for him to get Peter's ability due to
his cells being different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>HE could go up to
Logan and it would be a huge power boost. He wouldn't know how to use
their ability but at least he could combine his amount of MC cells
into one. The problem with that was that it required Sil to help. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without Quinn here,
Sil seemed disinterested in the whole event, the only other time he
would come out was the situation of the body being in danger. Looking
at the creature in front of him, they would die before even finding
out they were in danger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only that, But
Peter needed Vorden's help. Based on the last attack, he had only
come out alive by the skin of his teeth. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, we

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This time, I'm
not trying to be rude, but your attacks would do nothing, and would
only get in the way. I'm afraid I'm only a little better than you in
this situation. We need Logan.&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>

longer,&quot; Logan replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Agin, Layla had
heard those words. There was nothing she could do and it was true. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While there were two
spirit spears inside it. The beast tried to swing its hand mid-air.
IT realised that for some reason it's attack wasn't as fast as it
usually would be. It continued to swing its arm downward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, the spirit
blades time had run out. As it swung its hand down it felt and looked
faster than all of the over attacks. Now that its speed had returned
to normal, It looked up at Peter. Ready to finish him off once again.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It prepared its legs
ready to spring into action once again, but just before it was about
to set off. Vorden threw another one of the spirit spears landing
right in the back of the beast's legs. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another spear came
out again, this time, the beast got out from his leading downward
position and moved to avoid the spear. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
he's figured it out,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;This is the problem
with high-level beasts.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now the beast was
looking in Vorden's direction. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No if they get
rid of him then I will have no support,&quot; Said Peter. &quot; I
have to fight.&quot; Readying himself he rushed forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast continued
to ignore Peter though, and it seemed like he was going to deal with
the biggest annoyance first which was Vorden. As his back was turned
something strange happened though. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As it looked down,
another spirit spear was stuck in its body. It was sure it was
keeping an eye on the other boy. So where did the spear come from? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Pretty boy,
you owe me a date after this one!&quot; Cia shouted. She had come out
from the side of the house, and was now standing in the street. She
wasn't confident that the attack would be able to land at the
distance she was at so she decided to come closer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although she was
scared, her mind was screwed on straight. If they wanted to live they
would all need to do their part. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the beast
could choose its target, Peter was already upon him and had thrown a
fist against his solid body. The beast was shifted from his position
a few inches back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did it not
hurt him? How are we meant to kill this thing,&quot; Peter said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast went
for the attack. Two spirit spears were thrown from both sides. The
beast moved instinctively avoiding the spears now. Although none of
the spears hit it would stop the beast from being able to land an
attack on Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two continued to
do this. While the whole situation was going on, even with the
beast's large body. The beast was able to avoid all of the spears
thrown by the two. It was starting to grow tired though, and without
the others realising it. It was inching its way towards one of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Storing the power in
its legs until it got close enough. It managed to avoid more of the
spears, then quickly contracting the roots of one of its legs, it
sprung forward to the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It didn't go for,
Vorden, or Peter, it went for Cia. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn, why
didn't I think of this,&quot; Vorden said and slapped a hand over his
face, annoyed at himself. It was a simple rule when fighting. In a
situation like this, it would clearly get rid of the weakest and most
annoying one first. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Their distractions
had only worked well so far thanks to both of them throwing the
spears. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now with it coming
straight towards her, the spear she had been throwing finally managed
to hit. However, it was useless, one or two spears weren't going to
do much in helping her fight against such a thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She didn't have the
crazy amount of experience Vorden did, and the reaction and speed
Peter head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I'm going
to die, I'm going to curse and look at what kills me right in the

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As it's bladed claw
was about to reach out and stab her in the face they were stopped
mid-air in its tracks inches away from her face. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The blade had been
stopped, if it had continued to move forward it would have pierced
her skull almost showing no resistance. Cia once again could live to
see what would happen in the next few moments, still unsure if she
would live past today. However, what she was surprised about was who
exactly had come to save her. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of the corner of
her eye, she could see a black hair boy, pulling and twitching off to
the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was his
name again Fex?' Cia thought. &quot;Wasn't he a level one?&quot; But
she didn't stay long to find out. While the beast was stuck in place
she quickly ran off to where Layla and Logan were standing down the
street a little away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast saw
it's bladed arm being wrapped around by the strange shadow substance,
while also being pulled by the strings. It was wondering just which
one was affecting it more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some reason,
even though it was using all its strength it was unable to move its
arm forward to kill its target. It was something it had never
experienced before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A whisper was
suddenly heard in Peter's ear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go join the
others,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;You've fought enough and if you get
hurt again, who knows if you will survive.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter looked to his
side and could see Quinn standing there. He had already equipped all
of his beast gear equipment on before coming over ready for a battle.
Still, even he and Fex were unprepared for what they were facing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at him,
there was no joy on his face, it was dead serious and Quinn was fully
concentrating. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you are in
trouble, I won't hesitate to sacrifice myself,&quot; Peter said as he
walked off to where the others were. Before leaving Peter turned once
again. &quot;Quinn, it's strong.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
beast, still curious about its movements Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[ The town has been
left behind, and in its empty place, the beasts began to take over.
Amongst the many, eventually, a single creature took over, calming
the seat and title of king... The others do his bidding as he
protects the treasure located in the tower.] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter didn't need to
say anything, for as soon as Quinn had seen the strange beast, the
system had immediately activated a quest for him. It had been a while
since the system automatically gave him a task. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually when it
would appear when he faced a strong opponent of some sort. This also
happened when he was to face Leo. He found it strange that nothing
had come up for the advanced tier beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But it was probably
because the system didn't deem it as special enough for the planet
they were on. What interested Quinn about this strange quest, was for
the first time, it seemed to tell a little bit about how the creature
came to be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is it because of
the area we are in? Maybe it is related to the vampires and not the
Dalki after all.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The information also
revealed that it had been acting as a guard for the tower. If such a
strong beast was guarding it and it had stayed underground, Quinn
couldn't even begin to imagine what it was trying to protect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lastly, the quest
reward for defeating the beast. Even when going against Leo there was
a clear quest reward an instant level up. For some reason though,
this one was hidden. He didn;t know why, but the fact that it was
hidden, only made him want to find out what it was more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The real problem was
though, could they beat it. A king tier beast. He started to think
back about all the students going up against the advance tier beats,
and even with fifty of them they were unable to kill such a thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ones that were
left able to fight on were, Fex, Vorden, himself and Logan. But it
seemed like Logan was still busy with something else. Cia was out of
it, and would no longer be any use. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The difference
between this fight and the one earlier was Fex and Quinn would be
willing to display their full powers. Cia could always be hypnotised
for later and even if she couldn't. the lives of all of them were
more important than one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast was no
longer curious about the strange shadow and strings, and pulled its
arm back out of the shadow, Seeing this Quinn quickly returned it to
himself. There was one great advantage to them being underground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's shadow
powers were stronger. Even with the artificial light source from
logan. Just being in a darker environment increased the distance of
his shadows. It was only because of this he was able to use it a
distance away from himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast moved
its hand, Fex for the first time could feel it's enormous strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What!, he
wasn't this strong before was he,&quot; Fex said, as his hands
started to ache holding onto the strings. &quot;Does this mean,
Quinn's shadow was doing most of the work?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could hold on no
longer on and it was just the waist. It seemed like the beast was
moving just fine with or without his strings. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I need to help

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was now
standing by the others' side, the five of them had gone to hide
behind a building, out of the street and out of the way of what was
about to go down. </FONT></FONT>

doing, it looked like it still wasn't ready yet and he couldn't join
the fight just yet. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Logan do you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Even if you do
copy my ability. It's not like others.&quot; Logan explained. &quot;You
won't be able to get a clear grasp and the ability itself is pretty
useless honestly. It was only because I was able to implement it with
my brains I was able to come up with a use. Not saying you don't have
brains of course but you understand...&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Noticing that Vorden
was trustworthy, and had come with ideas so far, Logan decided to put
a bit of faith in him. Part of the suit that was covering the arm
shifted upward, as the suit broke down into the hundreds of little
spiders. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And the two had
touched hands. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, Vorden
started to move. He didn't go onto the street like the others thought
he would, instead he went through the buildings down the side looking
for the perfect spot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His aim was never to
use Logan's ability, but only wanted the MC cells that came with it.
He had already used a large amount throwing out spears constantly.
Still, with Logan's level 8 ability, he had to have a large amount,
not only that but if he could get Raten or Sil to fight. They would
be able to combine the other abilities. Making a spirit spear above a
level 8 ability. The level four's didn't do much, but surely this
would have an effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only problem
was, the beast was now cautious against the spears, so Vorden wanted
to get in the perfect location, waiting for the right time.
Sometimes, when the ability level was higher, it would also consume
more MC points with each use of the ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no time
for testing, and no second chances against a foe like this. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is
crazy!&quot; Cia shouted. &quot;Why are the two level ones, the
weakest in our team out there fighting. Are they idiots are they
trying to get themselves killed,&quot; She yelled. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, a hand had
come towards her face, and the right side of her cheek was stinging.

the one who had done it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Energy blade,

energy blades seemed to respond. It grew twice in size and Logan
slashed down with all his strength. It went through the beast's side
and the sound of something falling to the ground was heard. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is
that!?&quot; Cia asked, amazed at what was happening. &quot;I've
never seen a weapon like that before. If he had stuff like that was
so effective...why doesn't everyone use it?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

Layla who was standing next to her didn't have the same look of
amazement on her face. Her forehead was wrinkled as she was in deep
concern. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The green blade that

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought this
was the case,&quot; Layla said. &quot;I've seen one of these before.
Or to be more precise I learned about this before. It's another way
to use the beast crystal that was discontinued by the military.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Discontinued,
but why?&quot; Cia asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you can
see, by using crystals as a raw form of energy, one is able to create
something called an energy blade. The problem is, all of its energy
is coming from the crystal and it needs a constant output to support
it. Using the raw energy rather than mixing it with other materials
creates a more powerful weapon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But this means
two things, First the weapon isn't permanent. Once all the energy
from the crystal has been used the weapon will disappear. This also
means that the weapon strength will vary depending on how much energy
is used when attacking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Because of
these reasons, the military decided that it was much more practical
to use the crystal core, to create beast weapons rather than energy
weapons. Energy weapons were fine for the low-end use, when using a
basic tier or intermediate crystal but anything above would be a
waste.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For someone like
Logan, intermediate crystals weren't too hard for him to come by. He
could always just purchase them online on the market place. The
problem was anything above that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Past the advanced
tier crystal, there weren't many people who sold them. This was even
true for the advanced tier crystals. Instead, people would post
requests, asking others to obtain a specific type of crystal for
them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was, Fex
had not anticipated needing more than two intermediate crystals on a
trip like this. It wasn't exactly something people freely carried
around with them either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
the attack was a success,&quot; Logan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the black blood
continuing to drop from the beast's wound, it decided to retreat for
the first time, leaping back. Fex wanted to chase after the thing but
when he took a step forward, his wounds seemed to have gotten the
better of him, as he went down to one knee, just stopping himself
from collapsing on the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no point
for Logan to give chase either. The energy blade was just that, a
blade of energy. Unlike traditional beast gear, it didn't give any
extra stats to the user and the suit he was wearing didn't either. If
he was to chase the beast he wouldn't catch up to the thing in a
million years. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, the
beast's wound started to bleed less. It looked like some vine-like
structures were starting to cover over the wound. Next, from the
wound a little stump was starting to grow. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Am I imagining
things, or is that thing starting to get smaller?&quot; Layla asked,
still looking from the side of the street. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're right,&quot;
Peter replied, still having his hand hover over his belly. At the
same time, he was looking at Cia in a slightly different way. 'I
never got an order not to hurt her today, right?' Peter thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group wasn't
imagining things. As the stump started to grow it looked like it was
forming another hand, at the same time, the beast was getting smaller
in size. As if he was taking his mass from one area and placing it in
another. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When it was all
done. The beast once again had two-bladed limbs that shined like
Jade. Only now, it was roughly the same height as a regular human. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like
we're going to have to go for round two.&quot; Fex groned out as he
lifted himself off the ground. He knew that without his help Logan
wouldn't be able to do much. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why don't you

also touch down on his shoulder. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn? But
how?&quot; Fex asked. Vampires had super natural healing abilities
but for serious life threatening wounds, the use of blood would be
needed . If the wound was bad, but not life threatening, they would
eventually heal up but get hungry in the process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But what was strange
about Quinn, was how quick he had healed. 'Did he use the flask?' </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We can talk

Fex. &quot;Take it, heal up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I guess, my guess

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was tempting for
Fex, but in the end, he refused again. &quot;No, Quinn not to be
rude, but you're too slow to go against something like this and there
might actually be a use and another way for us to get out of this
mess if I don't use it. You keep it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Fex had said

Quinn's stats. Each time it went up by ten, there was a significant
improvement and even he could feel this. From 18 to 19 in a stat

going from 19 to 20. The change could be felt and was tremendous. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being able to just
dodge the attacks wasn't going to be enough. Whenever an opening
appeared, Quinn tried his best to throw out a punch, but the beast's

Quinn's attacks or even move out of the way. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blood Hammer was
still the strongest skill in Quinn's arsenal, but it took quite a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While dodging the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With this in mind,
Quinn threw out a punch from above, using his speed, he threw out one

the second one, it twisted its body slightly to avoid the blow. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Deeply confused by
what just happened, the others thought it must have been a mistake on
the beast's part. Perhaps, Logan's attack had hurt it more than they
thought and now its movements weren't as swift as before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only one that
knew what had happened was Quinn himself. He used the Phantom Punch,
this was an attack that would only work on humanoid creatures with a
certain level of intelligence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wasn't so sure
if it would really work but it was obvious that it worked and was
incredibly useful in the battle. Those with high intelligence
wouldn't be tricked by the phantom punch, at the same time, beasts
whose intelligence were far too low wouldn't even recognize the trick
in the first place. This was the reason why the Phantom Punch
wouldn't work on most beasts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it seemed
like the beast in front of him was perfect for the Phantom Punch. The
level of intelligence was enough for it to be tricked, but not high
enough to recognize that it was being tricked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The standoff between
the two continued, with Quinn avoiding most of the blows cleanly, and
whenever an opening revealed itself., Quinn would throw multiple
punches mixing in a Phantom Punch in between. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, another
blow landed, this time on the beast's neck just above its chest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Again, is the

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex could see that
the beast hadn't slowed down at all. Its movements were still as fast
as ever, so what was happening? It was simply incomprehensible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, the tide
was starting to turn. As Quinn continued on with the fight, he
started to be the aggressor more often. Hiding his Phantom Punches in
between the ordinary jabs. The outsiders felt as if the beast was the
one on the defensive and that it was delivering itself onto the path
of Quinn's attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It would constantly,
dodge and lean onto Quinn's fists. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, instead of
dodging. The beast decided to block the upcoming attack. Lifting its
arm, it covered its rounded head, but with its movements. Quinn took
the opportunity to send a blow to its stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, Fex
finally understood what was happening, &quot;It's got to be the
Phantom Punch. I can't think of anything else. He's mixing it with
the ordinary jabs and hooks. But who taught him the Phantom Punch,
and when? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He was just in
the school with me, or could it be that the other vampire is teaching
him in the school again?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even with all these
points, and even if Quinn did have a teacher that was in the school.
It didn't explain the crazy amount of time it had taken him to learn
such a skill. Now, Fex was starting to feel frightened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before it was
amazing, but every time he saw Quinn get stronger, a strange feeling
overcame him, before he was sure he was always stronger then him. Now
though, he couldn't say for sure. It was as if he was looking at two
different people. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The punches
continued to descend like a waterfall, and now it looked like the
beast was getting bullied. The monster that they were all afraid off
just a few moments ago was getting punched left and right by Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I was wrong,&quot;

Quinn, even she hadn't expected something like this from him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although, the tides
had turned in the fight, with Quinn being able to attack the beast
several times. It was having no effect on it whatsoever. The blows
didn't leave any wounds or marks and it had barely moved from its
original position due to Quinn's attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought,
otherwise why would the beast attempt to block the attacks? Still, he
wasn't doing enough damage, and if he continued on like this, his
stamina would run out before the beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like I

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was still a
problem though. The Hammer Strike may be quicker than the Blood
Hammer, but it was still far too slow for the beast. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another Phantom

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The movements of the

it did all of this, its movements slowed down, and its feet got stuck

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It hadn't noticed

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Placing his foot
down, and pulling one arm back, he snapped the other one out, hitting

slightly above everyone else. Vorden had the best view of what was
going on down below. The two girls along with Peter were at the

still close enough so they could see everything. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Carefully, he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia's ability
limited her to creating only one spear at a time. This limit was
still there even with the increase of power, but there were a couple
of differences. More MC cells could be put into the spirit spear
creating a more powerful spear. How long or what the effects were,
they couldn't tell until the spear was thrown. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once they obtained
this information, Vorden felt like it was best to create a stronger
spear, one as strong as possible. They might only have one chance at
this, the more powerful the attack when using an ability, the more MC

was completely black. No emotion was felt from them. &quot;Is he even
still sane?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perhaps, for a
vampire to turn into a blood sucker, they must have an immense amount
of thirst.&quot; the system explained. &quot;My guess is, when he was
wounded from the beast, he suppressed his healing abilities, allowing
the blood to continue to drain from his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When enough
blood had poured out, he allowed his body to heal, using the last bit
of his energy. Once the healing process was completed and his powers
had been used, his thirst was at its maximum. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a risky
thing to do, if you allow too much blood to leave your body, and your
wounds aren't able to heal then it could be life threatening. I'm
surprised this young boy knew how to do such a thing. Vampires aren't
often taught this, for a bloodsucker doesn't even see its own kind as
a friend. Which would suggest, he really is an important figure.
Perhaps the son of one of the vampire heads.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the
explanation was interesting for Quinn, he didn't have much time to

from foe</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fight continued
on between the Bloodsucker and the king tier beast. At first, when
the two of them fought it looked fairly even between them. Neither
one of them was getting significantly hurt from the other. This was
good for Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When a vampire
turned into a Bloodsucker, their health, or in Quinn's case Hp was
halved. Their wounds would also no longer heal. It was a starved
state for vampires. A mode that allowed them to grow stronger in
order to consume blood. But also acted as a double edged sword. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, slowly one
of them was starting to get an edge and it looked like it was the
Bloodsucker. Quinn was starting to notice that the power and the
speed of the king tier beast was finally starting to slow down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had been in
combat with multiple opponents and multiple times, so it made sense
to Quinn but this wasn't the reason why. The beast had an inhuman
amount of stamina and could continue to fight the students for hours
on end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason why it
was starting to slow down and weaken was because of its rage mode.
Simply put, the crystal inside was drawing out more power then it
could generate and now the beast was slowly dying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not understanding
what was happening, Quinn felt like this was his chance to attack.
Whatever happened he needed to get that last hit. He had used most of
his MC points during the fight and right now the only skill he could
use, was the shadow cloak. Which he used to hide his presence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing what was
happening, Quinn planned to inch closer and closer and try to get
behind the king tier beast. While it was distracted fighting, Quinn
would prepare the blood hammer and perform a flash step dashing him
forward just before delivering the punch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Trying to implement
his strategy, he slowly started to creep towards the fight. On the
street, Quinn and the others were stationed on the side of Fex, while
the beast was on the other side which led towards the tower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fight was still
hectic, and the two would span the whole width of the street. The
king tier beast threw one of its arms out and the Bloodsucker managed
to grab it. Using it's increased strength it yanked the arm as hard
as it could, ripping it from the beast's shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Black blood once
again started to squirt out from the wound. Quinn had seen this
before when Logan had done the same thing, soon the beast would heal,
but this was Quinn's chance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Running forward and
around the two, he wanted to get behind the fight. As he took a step
to the side, suddenly, a large claw-like fist came out towards him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fist was briefly
stopped by the shadow, and when he looked at where it had come from
it was from the Bloodsucker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'It could sense
where I was even with the shadow cloak on?' Quinn thought. 'Luckily,
I thought something might have happened and prepared my shadow just
in case.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly, Quinn
stepped back and went to his position before. It looked like Fex
really could no longer tell between friend and foe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, there was
another problem on Quinn's hands. The attack from the Bloodsucker,
although it was blocked by the shadow that would be the last one. For
now, Quinn's Mc points had reached zero. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He couldn't complain
though. Due to being underground, he was able to use the shadow more
often than he usually would have. It seemed like his powers and the
amount of Mc points taken to use the skills had lessened while down
here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Yes, he could no
longer use his shadow cloak, but against these two, there was no
point using it anyway. They both could sense his presence with or
without the shadow cloak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing was,
now the others could see him as well. When Quinn had disappeared,
they thought he perhaps had left the scene. They never imagined he
was still staying so close to the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, what
are you doing, leave it to the two monsters,&quot; Vorden said from
above. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Does your
friend have some type of pride or something?&quot; Cia said. &quot;The
only reason I can think of him staying is that he wants to be the one
to kill the beast.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla actually
agreed with Cia for once, she didn't know the reason why Quinn had
chosen to stay. Was he worried about Fex? Or was it something else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast had done
the same as last time after its arm had been ripped out. It wanted to
take a few steps back and start to recover but the Bloodsucker wasn't
going to let it go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the beast
dashed backwards, the Bloodsucker gave chase. Before the others would
have been too slow. It didn't expect something to be able to match it
in speed down here. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With a swipe to its

once again. </FONT></FONT>

getting the quest reward for killing the thing, Quinn dashed forward.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he got close to
the two of them, the Bloodsucker had turned around. The beast behind
it looked like it was barely standing. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on! Come
at me Fex!&quot; Quinn shouted as he threw out his leg, Performing a
vertical slice of red aura. Seeing this the Bloodsucker leapt up in
the air and it looked like it would close the distance between the
two with one jump. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

would hold up buildings. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, I can't
produce another one like that! Finish him now if you can!&quot; a
voice was heard shouting from down the street. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking behind the
Bloodsucker, Quinn could see Vorden running towards him. The spear
had come from him. Waiting for the right moment to throw the spear
into the king tier beast. It looked like it never would happen, and
eventually, the beast had already died, but Vorden was glad he had
held out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Quinn's
attack, he could see what was going to happen and threw out the large
spirit spear into Fex. It was thanks to this that the blow was
significantly reduced in terms of power and speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, Vorden knew
he needed to continue and act fast. After throwing out the larger
sprit spear, he was unable to produce it again. Because of this,
Raten switched places back with Vorden, and had run out, hoping to
support Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could only throw
the regular spears out now, but it was better than nothing. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Kill Fex?&quot;
Quinn said. No, he couldn't do that. It was only because of him they
were able to kill the king tier beast in the first place. They could
have quite possibly had all died there today. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't fair for
them to hurt thier saviour. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
want to do?&quot; A voice said next to Quinn's right. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had now joined
them as well. Vorden was stood off to the right of the Bloodsucker,
While Quinn and Peter were stood on the other side of the street.
Logan was still hurt and patching himself up by the two girls next to
one of the buildings. Still staying out of trouble. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While watching what
was going on, the girls started to hear a few voices from somewhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So just a
little further ahead and the beast you encountered before should be
here?&quot; A confident young voice said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes sir, every
time we wanted to go explore the tower, the beast would come out and
stop us. This happened several times while trying to make our way
towards the tower, no matter what direction we came from. It seems to
be protecting something.&quot; A female voice said. &quot;Unfotuently,
each time we faced the beast, although we were able to come out with
our lives, we were unable to defeat it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would agree
with your prediction.&quot; The confident voice replied. &quot;You
were right to not report this to the other shelters, as well as the
military shelter. Hopefully, that treasure can do well for our
faction.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sir, what do
you think about that loud bang we heard a few moments ago. Do you
think this place was discovered by others?&quot; Another male's voice
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's why
we're heading there now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group continued
to talk, and Layla and Cia, were starting to hear the voices even
louder now. Soon they could see just where the conversation was
coming from. Down the street, a group of travellers were walking
together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was easy to spot
them since each of them had a sticky light patch on them. It worked
similar to a torch, only it didn't need to be held and could just be
stuck on top of thier armour. It also glowed the surrounding area
rather than just one direction. It allowed the area around the person
to be bathed in light. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't they
look kind of familiar?&quot; Cia thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The girls didn't
come running out. Just because they saw things that looked like
humans didn't mean they were, but as they got closer it turned out
they really had seen them before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, back at
the shelter.&quot; Layla replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were the group
of travellers who had reported to the military updating them about
the exploration. Judging by the conversation they had just overhead.
It looked like they hadn't exactly been truthful with thier report
either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla wanted to move
from thier position. They weren't inside a particular building but
were just between two buildings down an alleyway. She still wasn't
sure about these people. If they could lie to the military, perhaps
they would also happily silence them, for being down here and knowing
about this place as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was
Logan, he still looked like he couldn't move. While she was thinking
about what to do, it was too late to do anything anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Other there.&quot;
A female voice said. &quot;It looks like there are other people here.
Heck, their kids aren't they.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group quickly
rushed over to students and were shocked at the state and just how
young the students where. After seeing their uniform, they quickly
figured out where they were from, the military. Something must have
happened the group thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were a group of
five. All of them had beast gear covering thier body. The female was
the first to approach them named Lilly, who also had a Bow on her
back. Only hers looked a level higher then what Layla had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then there was a
couple of bald-headed twins. Each of them didn't hold a weapon in
thier hand, but there leg's were covered in thick boots, while the
rest of thier leg's had light armour, it was a strange sight. They
were called Rock and Pock. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was then
another man, who seemed to always be staying by the youngest looking
person's side. He had a shield on his back with a sword sheathed by
his waist. The man looked a little older than the others. It was as
if he was assigned to look after the whole team, but after listening
to them for a while. Layla quickly figured he wasn't the leader. It
was the young man standing next to them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The young man had
brown wavy hair that was tied up in a ponytail. His weapon of choice
was a spear that was as long as himself placed on his back. The most
noticeable thing about him was the air around him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was full of
confidence and one with a look of experience. When Layla looked at
him, she was reminded of Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Im the leader
Andre.&quot; the young man said. &quot;What happened here, did you
guys get attacked?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, move!&quot;
Vorden shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Andre asked the
question, he had heard voices from down the street. When the group
turned to look, they could see the three other students all fighting
against a strange creature. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is that the
beast you guys encountered before Andy?&quot; Andre asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No sir. That's
something else. I've never seen that before.&quot; The older man Andy
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It doesn't
matter, they're in trouble and we need to slay the beast.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then from the
shadows, behind where the group had just come from. The sound of loud
footsteps was heard. Out from the darkness slowly, a figure started
to come out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Another beast,
and it's a strong looking one. Turn around.&quot; Cia said in a
panic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the group or
travellers didn't look panicked at all. The strange beast looked a
bit like a Lion, and was the same size as one. Its muscles could be
seen as well but on its bottom half. Instead of a single tail, it
carried several each one with a small flame at the end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The lion approached
Andre's side and started to lick him on the face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A tame beast?&quot;
Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thats right.&quot;
Lilly replied. &quot;You guy's don;t have to worry about a thing, we
will get rid of that beast for you. For you see, our leader here, is
from one of the big four families.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the leader of
the travelers being able to control, and have a beast by his side
like that. Meant that Andre must have been a member of the Bree
family. This family wasn't any regular family, for they were one of
the big four. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at
Andre though, Layla felt like it wasn't anyone she recognized.
Although, those from the big four families, other than the leaders
hardly any of the others were recognisable unless they had a bad
reputation. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Bree family were
a bit unique compared to the other strong families and original
families out there. Their ability had always existed only it wasn't
as threatening as the others. Before earth started the exploration of
beast planets, the Bree family were only able to tame one thing, the
current animals on earth. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was only after
the exploration had started that their true power came to light.
Beasts from other planets were a lot stronger than animals back on
earth. Depending on their level and control of the ability, it
allowed them to tame higher and lower level beasts. It would also
affect the amount of beasts they could control at one time as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Their power was
borrowed power in a way. They weren't the ones that did the actual
fighting, or this is what others would think. It was the general
thought between the public or those that had never seen a Bree
before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Bree's were
actually incredibly talented when it came to fighting. For when
taming a stronger beast, one would have to show it was stronger than
what it was trying to tame. There would be cases where this wasn't
needed, but for the higher levels it was a different story. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With their
incredible fighting skills and strong beasts they were able to work
together, creating a powerful force and eventually climbed up the

wasn't enough to make it at the leaders table. </FONT></FONT>

didn't know what it was but it was as if their body was being
controlled. The other continued to run forward unaware of what was
happening to the other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Throwing out a fast
punch, the twin was prepared to block the attack, lifting its two
arms in an x-like shape, but the attack had never come. Suddenly, he
felt a heavy fist in the stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Blood spray!' At
the same time as the punch was released, Quinn used his blood spray
at close range sending one of them flying backwards. By now the other
had been released from the stun and came charging forward hoping to
help out his brother. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A kick was released
at an amazing speed. Using the power of the wind behind his kick,
rather than releasing it as an attack at the end, he was able to
speed up his attack considerably. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Quinn
decided to match him toe to toe, throwing out a kick of his own just
as fast. The two legs clashed mid air as both of their shins striked
each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Who is this
person?' The twin thought. 'He's just as fast as me, and I have beast
gear on as well as using my wind abilities. The gear he's wearing
doesn't look like it's made from high level beasts. So what could it
be?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While in the middle
of his thought, he could see a flurry of fists coming towards him. He
had knocked away the first one and attempted to block the second
moving his head to the side. Once again, just like with his brother,
the attack that was meant to come had never come, and a fist came out
from a different direction altogether, hitting him right on the head
and knocking him down to the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With this attack
Quinn decided to not use his blood spray. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using the spray with
his punches once in a while and the blood swipe, it would
continuously lower his HP. It was the big downside of using the blood
abilities. Still, with the phantom punch other than his mind feeling
more tired as he used it, he had another skill he could rely on. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both Andy and Andre,

of their men. This had surprised Andre. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two Quinn had
dealt with, they weren't weak. They were strong, and had gone on
countless orange planet expeditions. They were even able to survive
and escape a confrontation with a king tier beast. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at Andre's
fight against Fex, Quinn could tell he was strong. The three of them
were evenly matched against him. Even with Quinn's speed increase and
power increase, he wasn't as strong as Fex in his current form. </FONT></FONT>

the tower, and closely behind him Fex chased after. The two of them
went off down the street into the darkness. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at the
two, Andre found it strange, it wasn't as if the creature was
following the strange masked man like he was his master. Instead it
looked like he was trying to kill him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had continued
to run full speed ahead, activating his wind walk boots, but he knew
it would be useless with the great speed of the bloodsucker. The only
thing he could do was run into buildings, to slow Fex down. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was able

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This should be
far enough.&quot; Quinn thought. In one of the abandoned buildings,
there was a large room that was mostly empty. He quickly placed the
flask on the floor and continued to run forward. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was still unsure
if Fex would continue chasing after him or go after the flask. When
fex reached the flask on the floor, immediately using its clawed
hands it picked it up and started shaking it and pouring it into its
mouth, it didn't allow a drip of it to touch the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the flask was
completely empty, the Bloodsucker started to sway, as if he was drunk
and was about to collapse on the floor, and soon after, he did. While
looking at the body from a distance it looked like the body was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Deciding not to
chase after the strange creature. Andre and Andy agreed to go over
and check on the two twins. They were no longer on the floor in pain.
Their armour had managed to take most of the damage. But still, the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was their job to
know who was on the orange portal planet with them. After all, they
would be working together and exchanging information while on the

planet. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Andre then knelt
beside the beast and started fleshing out certain parts of the
beast's cadaver. They knew what he was doing, he was looking for the
beast's crystal. Only after fleshing out several different areas of
the body with his small dagger did he finally found the crystal. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The extracted
crystal didn't look like common at all. It was clearer and wasn't as

any light nor sheen at all. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, an

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perhaps it was
killed recently,&quot; Andy replied. &quot;Also, the fact that there
is no glow would suggest that the beast had gone into a type of rage
mode.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this the two
twins gulped. They remembered how tough and frightening it was to
fight this beast without it going into a type of rage mode. To be
honest, the two felt that they were lucky to be alive fighting
against such a beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

able to hide his identity using the costume and mask Logan had
created for him. Also, Fex was unrecognisable as the bloodsucker. He
had his uniform on, but in the fight with the King-tiered beast, it

had been watching the fight carefully and wanted to join in, but she

other creature was, and last of all? What about the strange Demon

little robots, but his ribs still hurt a little as he breathed in. He
then walked over to the travelers and lifted up showing his wrist
watch reavilling he was a level 8. </FONT></FONT>

finally able to kill the king tier beast. Right after, that strange
creature had appeared and had taken me out of the fight, leaving the

appeared at the end. Your guess is as good as ours. He only appeared
when you guys saw him as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Andre started to
think about Logan's words. They were convincing and the power level
on his watch was even more convincing, but what had convinced him
more than anything was the starne round circular contraption that was
on top of his hands. He noticed straight away that they were used to
create energy weapons. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the use of an
energy weapon, what Logan had said would be quite achievable.
Especially as a level 8 ability user. Also it was hard to imagine why
the students would even lie in this type of situation, when they had
seen first hand the creature trying to kill them. </FONT></FONT>

into a monster,and Quinn was nowhere to be seen after killing the
king tier. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The tower can

feel like we have made a mistake in not informing the military in
what was down here. Now the lives of students and perhaps others have

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Andy looked annoyed,
they had been fighting for days, trying to defeat the king tier beast

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before heading off
to the tower, Quinn made sure of two things. The first thing was that
his MC points were fully restored. Fex had been out for a while, so
they only needed to wait a little longer before starting their
journey again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second thing was
that he was fully equipped with all his equipment. Of course, that
included his suit which was made by Logan. He wore this as normal,
all apart from the head part, only allowing his eyes to come through.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The suit was easily
adjustable, and at any time, Quinn could quickly lift up the hood to
cover the top part of his head quickly. And that's why it wasn't a
problem for him if he wanted to hide his identity from others. The
reason for him doing this was because he no longer had his blood
bank. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His second chance.
In all of his fights so far, he had always relied on the blood bank
to help him in his time of need. There was no more blood in the
flask. Fex had consumed all of it, and in doing so, it looked like
his wounds were healing too. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The armour that
Logan created gave him some additional defence. Although it wasn't
much, every little increment would help, and this was his reason for
putting it on. They were about to head to the tower, and if the guard
outside was that strong, Quinn feared that perhaps there was an even
stronger guard inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If that was the
case, he wouldn't even bother fighting and abandon the quest. No
matter how curious he was, or how good the reward for the quest was,
it wasn't worth his life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you all
ready, then?&quot; Quinn asked Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While they were
waiting for both Fex's wounds to heal and Quinn's MC points to
return, Fex was troubled in his thoughts. This whole time, he was
thinking about Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, wait,&quot;
Fex said as he rushed over and bowed down on one knee with his fist
on the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whoa, what's
this all about?&quot; Quinn asked, shocked by Fex's actions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have to do
this, please. Quinn, you saved my life. I remember everything that
happened while I was the Bloodsucker. When those travellers came and
found me, you were already safe. The king tier beast was dead and the
only thing that was trying to kill you all was me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I knew it was
a risk turning into that thing, but it was the only thing I could
think of at the time. When you saw that I was hurt and you were all
safe, you risked your life. You fought against those travellers and
risked me chasing after you. Finally, you used the flask that I had
given you to save me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After saying these
words, Fex punched the ground in anger. Quinn didn't quite understand
this action, but he was sure it was because he was angry at himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This whole time, he
had been getting closer to Quinn for one reason, to save his own
behind. If he was ever to be found out by his own clan, then Fex's
idea was to turn Quinn in as one of the shadow users. With this
information that he had brought to the leader, his father, the
punishment he would receive for running to the human world without
permission would be light. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn, he had
never thought about abandoning him. He had even risked his life going
against a group that was able to outmatch him even as a Bloodsucker.
Fex no longer cared about how he was able to do it, or why he seemed
to keep growing stronger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He just had this
feeling of guilt over his heart that he wanted to get rid of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know I said
this before, but seriously. If there is anything you need help with,
don't hesitate to ask. I am on your side, Quinn.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't know
what to say. These actions seemed out of the blue to him. Someone who
was never serious since the day he had met him, was suddenly being
very serious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the time, Quinn
had only done what he felt was right. Fex had risked his life to save
the whole group. What right did he have to die by the hand of
strangers? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, seeing him
like this, Quinn didn't know why, but he naturally walked over to Fex
and extended his hand. Fex, in return, naturally took it and lifted
himself up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We're blood
brothers from now on.&quot; Fex said with a smile. &quot;We may not
be related by blood, but I will treat you just as if you were apart
of my family.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And I will do
the same,&quot; Quinn said with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
headed off for the tower and while on their way, they were both
cautious with their footsteps. Then again, Quinn was a little less
worried than Fex seemed to be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Judging by the text
of the quest from earlier and the information it had given him, the
quest indicated that the strongest beast outside of the tower was
king tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the information
was correct, it meant that there was nothing else outside of the
tower that was stronger than the king beast. Still, that also meant
there was the possibility of them running into advanced or
intermediate tier beasts. Although they would be able to do something
since they're together, with no blood and no humans around, it would
be risky going into battle after battle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After slowly
creeping their way towards the tower, by going through buildings,
rather than go down the open street towards the tower, it seemed like
they hadn't seen a single beast on their way there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This included the
hounds they had first seen when they arrived. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is it the strange
crystals from the top of the tower, or did the other beast just stay
away from this place because of the king tier beast?' Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, they had
arrived at the location of the tower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The street that led
to it finally ended and there was now a large empty ring of space
surrounding before the tower. The circle had several paths leading
off towards other streets surrounded with buildings, but nothing
apart from the tower stood alone in the centre. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The crystals shone
brightly at the top and gave off a slightly blue hue to the area
below it. When looking at the houses and each others' faces, it
looked quite beautiful and peaceful, Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could see some
pluses of living in a place like this, despite it being away from the
sunlight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Maybe I am becoming
more like a vampire if I think a place like this is nice to live,' he
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We can take
out some time exploring if you're worried,&quot; Fex said as he saw
Quinn admiring the tower. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I just thought you
might be worried. The others would leave with those travellers. More
than likely, they already know of an exit. I asked my little Ham, to
follow them from above. Once he knows where the exit is, he'll come
and find me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ham, is that
the little flying bull from earlier?&quot; Quinn was quite interested
in the companion, wondering if he was able to get something like that
himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah. Good
name, right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ignoring Fex's last
words, Quinn continued to walk up to the tower. There was a single
large double door with an arched entrance. The door was engraved with
strange patterns, all of which Quinn had seen in images before when
learning about the dalki architecture. But right now, he wasn't too
sure if it was Dalki-related or vampire-related. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the door in the
centre was a circular hole that seemed to go a few inches deep. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a lock,&quot;
Fex said. &quot;These doors, I've seen them in my own castle before.
They're impossible to open without some type of key or mechanism.
Also, don't even think about trying to break it. Trust me, they're
meant to even withstand attacks from the vampire leaders.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Doesn't that
mean that there really is something important behind here?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, but I
don't know what,&quot; Fex replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Going up to the
door, Quinn decided to try and give it a push using all his strength.
He was half expecting it to do something, but just like Fex had
informed him, it wasn't budging at all. It was hard to imagine while
watching Quinn trying his hardest to push the door open that he had
some type of super strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I told you it
was pointless, man. I hate to say it, but perhaps this was a wasted
trip after all. Let's just rest somewhere nearby and wait for Ham,
and then we can get out of here,&quot; Fex shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Quinn was
about to agree and head off, the system had something to say. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't give up
yet,&quot; the system said. &quot;Do you remember that red blood
crystal you received from defeating the king tier beast? Why don't
you place that on the door and see what happens?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system seemed to
know more about this place than it was letting on. Doing as the
system said, Quinn took out the red blood crystal from his inventory
and placed it in the strange hole inside the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex, who was seeing
this, was wondering just what he was doing, but a few moments later,
the sounds of mechanical locks from behind the door being unlocked
were made. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Gears started to
shift and the doors started to pull inwards, opening up a way inside
the tower. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the group was
walking, Logan and Peter made sure to stay at the back. However, Lily
continued to stay behind the entire group as a type of guard, just in
case anything would appear. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, how

something by then,&quot; Logan whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter, immediately
looked up at Logan from his bent down position. He didn't say
anything. Instead, his eyes were starting to show a slight tint of
red in them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay. Looks

to rack his brain at every option possible. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the group
had reached one of the tunnels that led out of the city from the
streets. While looking at all the tunnels around them, Logan thought
the place resembled an ant's nest with the many branching tunnels in
the end all leading to one destination. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While walking
through the tunnels, Logan had come up with an idea that perhaps
would enable Peter to feed away from everyone. But before executing
the idea, he needed to get some information. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So with all
these tunnels, how do you guys know the way out?&quot; Logan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;These tunnels
are like a maze and they either seem to loop to each other, or all
end up going back to the original town we just left from,&quot; Andy
replied. &quot;In the end, we never found an exit, so we decided to
create our own. One of the tunnels we marked ourselves. When we
noticed the blue crystal lights, we placed red lights by the tunnel
we created ourselves that led up to the surface.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the answer on
how to leave the place, Logan could now execute his plan. The other
students, including Logan, had actually come down the tunnels via the
strange plant-like beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan had scanned
the place before coming down, so he knew there was a space between
the surface and the ground they were currently on and was prepared
for it. But even Peter had broken his legs when dropping from such a
height, and he had a stronger structure than a regular human. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a sad
thought, but some of the other students were consumed by the strange
plant-like beast. A few of them were most likely unable to make it
and had fallen to their death. Unless they had an ability that could
save them, this would be the case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All Logan needed to
do was to make them split up with the others and search through the
tunnels for one of these dead students that Peter could feed on. It
wouldn't be too strange if the teachers found a student's corpse
half-eaten. Beasts would do these type of things all the time. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the group
had exited from the tunnel and entered another larger section with
several more tunnels. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed too
sudden. By Logan's predictions, they should have had more time.
Looking around the room though, he had soon spotted the cause. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His theory was
right, some students really had fallen to their death after being
consumed by the plant because there was a couple of students in front
of them, their bodies mangled on the ground. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The smell and sight
of the students had caused a reaction inside of him. If he hadn't
seen them, then perhaps they really would have had more time. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not knowing what to

up from the ground. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it wasn't for the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, what are

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Lily shouted out again, genuinely concerned for the two, so she
decided to chase after them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Logan's
hand had transformed into one of his blasters. He aimed it at the
ceiling and blasted it away, causing the tunnel to crumble down,
blocking the path between them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wouldn't stop
them, especially with their powers, but Logan wasn't hoping for that.
He had analysed their leader Andre, and he was quite a smart man.
Hopefully, him seeing Logan do these actions would suggest that
something was up, knowing they didn't want to be followed. With his
cautious nature, he would suggest for them to first go back and hand
over the students before returning and Logan was right. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We should go
after them,&quot; Lilly suggested. She was genuinely concerned for
the students safety. Especially since she was the only one that heard
one of the students make a strange noise before everything had
happened, and she codlin;t help but wonder if they were related. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No,&quot;
Andre replied. &quot;Couldn't you see it? The other student caused
the tunnel to collapse on purpose. They wanted to split up for us for
whatever reason. For now, it's best if we leave that mystery unsolved
and head back to the base. The students must be scared out of their
minds after seeing what they have seen today.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group continued
to walk through the tunnels, while also instructing the students to
look away from the dead bodies. Cia tired to stay strong but
continued to put her hand over her mouth and eyes as she caught
glimpses of the bodies. But the others walked past them with more
ease than her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Andre, seeing this,
made a mental note. It was as if Vorden and Layla had seen death
before. The normal reaction to such a thing would be similar to what
Cia had done. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I was to

put his neck out on the line like that for no reason.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Impossible.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although that might
have been the case before. Logan had used up several of his trump
cards in the fight against the king tier beast. He was also slightly
injured from the battle, and lastly, Quinn had grown stronger from
the fight. Which meant, Peter had too. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I had my

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First, a
vampire tomb doesn't necessarily mean a vampire is dead. A vampire
can choose to go into eternal slumber, which is similar to death but
not the same. If they are one of quite a high position or of
importance to people, one of these towers will be created for them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Eternal
slumber means a vampire has chosen to go to sleep forever themselves,
it's a permanent state and there is only one way to be woken up from
it. By consuming blood from someone of the same family. They do not
need to be related by blood but only contain the same blood. An
example of this is if you were to go into eternal slumber, then Peter
would be able to wake you up with his own blood, as he is a part of
your family but Fex's blood would be useless.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are there

worried they might encounter something. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Usually, I
would say not, Could you imagine asking someone to look over such a
place and for how long? They could be in the tower for a very long if
so. I would be bored out of my mind staying in such a dull place. My
guess is two things. Either the vampire was a powerful one and his
magic was so great he was able to convince the king tier beast to act

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;In order to
keep it under its control for so long, it handed the blood crystal
which you obtained after defeating the beast. My second guess would
be after the beast found the blood crystal, it was compelled to this
area. Something was telling it there was something powerful inside
and it didn't know how to use it, at the same time it couldn't leave
this place due to its curiosity of power.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both things sounded
possible. What Quinn didn't want it to be was some ancient powerful
vampire that had decided to go to sleep on another planet somewhere.
At least there was no chance for Quinn to wake it up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was human, and he
was his own family member. His blood couldn't be used to wake up any
vampire. With this, Quinn decided to carry on forward. If this was a
grave, then maybe just like pharaohs did of the past, they would bury
themselves with their treasures. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Excited by this
prospect, he started to jog after Fex who had gone quite away ahead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After they both
followed the torches down the path, it eventually led them to a large
staircase leading upward. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If these

walk all the way up.&quot; Fex said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had no choice
and started their climb. It wasn't as hard as Quinn initially
thought, the stairs were many and if it was Quinn before he had
turned into a vampire, he would've had to take several breaks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
powered through the many stairs and didn't really feel tired,
however, they did feel like the stairs would go on forever and were
wondering when they would end. Finally, the stairs had levelled out
onto a platform and another large door could be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the same size
as the one at the entrance only this one didn't have a strange lock

leading up suggesting they hadn't reached the top yet. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe we
should check it out before we continue going upward?&quot; Quinn
suggested. &quot;Wouldn't want to miss out on anything.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With a strong push,
the doors opened. They were heavy, but with the two of them, they
were able to swing the door open. Just like when they opened the door
below. Torches around the room suddenly lit up. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead of lighting
up a path, this time, the whole room was lit up. It was a fairly
large square room but at the same time, it was nearly completely
bare. There was nothing inside the room apart from five podiums in
the centre of the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each podium had an
item on them. They were pieces of armour, a chest piece, a leg piece,
an arm piece, and a helmet. Lastly on the final podium was a ring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The armour had a
strange medieval design to it, and didn't look like any of the beast
gear Quinn had ever seen. It looked almost like knightly armour, only
with points and such at the end, while red in colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't
believe it.&quot; Fex said. &quot;This is really ancient old vampire
combat armour. I've only seen these things in books. Not even our
castle has a set like this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex slowly walked
over to the items, afraid that there might be traps around the room,
while heading over to the podium he carefully placed each foot but
found no such thing. The first podium he arrived at wasn't any of the
pieces of armour, instead it was the ring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This looks
like the one I'm wearing but slightly different. Maybe you can wear
this.&quot; Fex said as he picked up the ring of the podium. In an
instant, the room felt like it was starting to shake. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What did you
do!&quot; Quinn complained. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nothing, I
just picked up the ring. I was sure there were no traps.&quot; When
Fex finished saying those words. A strange circular cylinder-like
shape, lifted up from the podium and covered each of the items. The
cylinder went all the way up to the ceiling of the room they were in.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the cylinders
were formed the vibrations had stopped, and it didn't seem like
anything else was going to happen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
strange metal cylinder, Fex gave it a knock a few times. &quot;Damn
it, there's no way we can get that equipment now. This material is
the same thing the door down below is made from.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing what had just
happened, Quinn could only assume the other items were locked away
once Fex had picked up the ring. Perhaps the same thing would have
happened after touching any of the items. Maybe the Vampire who slept
here was giving them a choice. A reward for discovering the place,
but rather than give them everything, he gifted them a single piece
of his treasure. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Here,&quot;

in the air and took a look at it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's yours,&quot;
Fex said. &quot;I already have one, and I feel like an idiot for
touching the ring before making sure everything was okay. If we were
only allowed to take one item, then I might have just picked the
suckiest out of them all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the
description of the ring, Quinn realised Fex must have made a mistake
thinking the ring was the same because it wasn't. Fex's ring was an
advanced level ring that was able to block out the sunlight for 3
hours at a time and he would have to go back inside to allow it to
recharge. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Turning his head
back and looking down the tunnel from where they had come from, Logan
could see that the others had chosen not to follow him. His plan that
he made with his quick thinking had obviously worked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even with Peter on
his shoulder, he never slowed down. He continued to run down the
tunnel until they had eventually reached an open space that had a lot
of different paths and tunnels for them to choose from. It was
similar to one of the areas where they just came from. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let go of me!&quot;
Peter shouted with his eyes now fully red, glowing in the dark. His

larger. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Feeling the weight

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking for some
kind of a solution, Logan picked out and held out his altered hand

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it just worked,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Quinn and Fex

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the black
substance that made up the whole tower was also incredibly strong,
just as strong as Gatherum. It would take nearly their entire

progress. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they left the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Also, when fighting,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe,
honestly I'm not sure, I think I saw one of the other vampire

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What exactly

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I suppose I
should tell you, you will have a tough decision ahead of you.&quot;
The system said. &quot; The blood crystal can be used just like a
beast crystal. They are used to either create armour or weapons. For
certain reasons, these crystals are a lot rarer then beast crystals.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are they

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's hard to
say honestly.&quot; The Unique thing about a blood weapon is it has
the ability to evolve and grow stronger. However, depending on the
crystal used, there is a limit to its growth and also its starting
point. What you have right now is your hand is the lowest tier of
blood crystals.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An evolving weapon
didn't sound too bad to Quinn. While others might be put off wanting
a straight-up powerful weapon. He didn't find it too troubling as it
was similar to the situation he himself was already in. The idea of
his weapon growing stronger while he did as well, sounded nice. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What put him off

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had two
choices, to hand in the crystal, or use it to create his own weapon.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just a second ago,
Peter was there right in front of Logan. It was only a brief moment,
but after checking his scanner and allowing his eyes to gaze down, he
looked back, and in front of him, no one was there. He had
disappeared entirely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing something so
dangerous potentially be anywhere in the room with him, was starting
to make even Logan nervous. He no longer had any sticky light balls
to shoot out, and his suit only produced enough light for him to be
able to see a few meters in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter could see as
clear as day down here. They were unfavourable odds, and Logan
started to curse himself, thinking about how he ever got himself in
this type of situation. Before he nearly did anything, in the past,
he always thought of the probability of something happening. The risk
he would put himself in before taking action. If the odds seemed
against him, he would never take the risk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when seeing
Peter writhing in pain and the others there, Logan had reacted on
instinct, moving him out of the area. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A sharp, sudden
sound was heard to his right, and a blast was shot from his blaster
in an instant. The explosion had only managed to hit the strange
black material which was as strong as always, causing no rubble or
stone to break off but leaving a peculiar smell from the blaster. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't want
to hurt you Peter. Suppose I hit you now before you've eaten
anything. There's a good chance you can't heal.&quot; Logan said
calmly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His voice was full
of confidence, but inside his mind were starting to panic a little.
Although Logan's reaction time wasn't beyond that of what a human
being was capable of. He was still quite confident in his skills to
hit something before it was able to move. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nearly all the
students at the school, apart from those with either high-level beast
gear, or speed related abilities, Logan was pretty confident he would
be able to hit them with his blaster. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the attack he
just fired right now, he couldn't even see Peter, or even an after
image. &quot;I guess you really do suit an assassin, but it isn't the
time to test it on me.&quot; Logan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he said those
words, groans could be heard once again in a specific direction. When
Logan looked at where they were coming from, he could see Peter knelt
down on the floor holding his stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Logan, just
leave me, I don't think it's safe, just go now!&quot; Peter shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ever since Peter had
evolved into a wight, his whole demeanour and attitude had changed.
The others thought the old Peter was completely gone... lost, but
that wasn't true at all. Peter still had feelings, he still had
worries, and inside he was still scared as always. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were times
when these old feelings and demeanour would show more than others,
and one of these times was when he spent time with Logan. He didn't
know why, but the others seemed to treat the new Peter different
compared to Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It felt like Logan
didn't care what he was and never found it strange the way the new
Peter acted. While with the others, he could always feel they felt
different. Like the Peter they were talking to wasn't the same
before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It hurt Peter
inside, especially since he knew he was still the same person. One of
these people who he could tell felt this way was Quinn. Someone who
he considered close. He could see every time Quinn looked at him; it
was different from the way he looked at Peter before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't a bad way,
but it was one of sadness. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Will I never be
good enough?' Peter thought, He wasn't back then, and he wasn't now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only person who
he was good enough for was Logan, and even now Logan had tried to
help him multiple times. If there was one person, he would do
everything in his power to not to eat or hurt, it was Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a moment, Peter
was able to fight back his hunger, but in return, he could feel all
the painful pangs in his body. As he looked up at where Logan was
before, he could see he had already run off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good.. you
listened..&quot; Peter said. He wasn't hurt this time. Seeing Logan
run off to save himself. He had already done enough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The pain continued,
and Peter honestly wondered if he was going to die. Although he could
have let the hunger takeover and his body run wild, he wanted to
remain in control of his body for as long as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the sound of
footsteps was heard. Echoing through as if someone was running
towards them through one of the tunnels. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, no, if
it's another person. I'll attack them as soon as I see them.&quot;
Said, Peter. &quot;Stay away, turn back!&quot; Peter shouted down the
tunnel. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the footsteps
only grew louder as the person was getting closer, then in the
darkness, a strange relatively large object was seen flying through
the air coming towards him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While it was hard to
see what it was, Peter knew. Or more to the point, his body knew as
he leapt through the air, and opened his jaw wide, grabbing the
flying object with his mouth. He immediately started to rip it apart
with his two front teeth and claws pinning it to the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out from the tunnel,
Logan had appeared with a student on his back. He placed it on the
floor and took a few steps back. &quot;I know this might be
disrespectful, but you are already dead. I Promise I will find out
who your family are and treat them well. They will live a life of
happiness due to your help for as long as I am alive.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys
continued to run through the town at breaking speed. On the way to
the tower, they hadn't seen any high-level beasts. Quinn was now sure
of it. There was nothing left underground that was stronger than the
king tier beast. With this thought in his head, he was able to freely
run as fast as he could towards Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was worried about

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I was right; he
really has grown stronger and at a crazy pace. He's a lot faster than
me, and I can barely keep up anymore. But how? Nothing I can think of
can make sense anymore. If I want to find out the truth, there's only
one thing I can do, ask. This time though, I won't ask for someone
else.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was always
hesitant to ask Quinn this question and before he didn't know why but
now he did. It was because he felt guilty. When thinking about asking
the question, in the back of his head, he knew he had an ulterior
motive. As if he was trying to find out some secret information to
bring back to his family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, he no longer
cared and had decided no matter what, he wouldn't reveal to anyone
about Quinn. Right now, he wanted to find out for himself, for his
own curiosity. Once they were out of this place. Fex wanted to find
out the secrets about Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Quinn
stopped in his tracks. He had completely slowed down and was no
longer running at full speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;
Fex asked. Truthfully Fex was out of breath, but seeing Quinn was
fine he tried his best to hide he was tired. As soon as Quinn turned
away, he would start panting. He still had his pride and didn't want
to show he was now weaker than his friend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were actually
two reasons why Quinn had stopped. The first was Quinn felt that
Peter was no longer hungry. The pain he was feeling up to this point
had disappeared. Quinn found it hard to believe that Peter would have
been able to eat someone in front of the travellers. He could tell
they were strong. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you,
Logan,&quot; Quinn said under his breath. He didn't know why but he
had a hunch if anyone could solve the problem it would have been him.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second reason
for stopping was because Quinn could sense and smell a familiar
presence. It didn't take long and soon Fex could smell who it was as
well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You seem to
always be in the most interesting Quinn. I think I should start
putting a tracker on you and just follow you around everywhere.&quot;
Out from one of the buildings, a slightly older bald man came out
with his trusty blade by his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

you're safe. I'm here to search for the remaining students. Your
friends who were with you have already been escorted outside to the

mid-sentence. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was strange, and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's wrong!&quot;
Quinn asked, genuinely concerned. His teacher had always been so
composed. Even when going up against the Dalki, he never once ran
away, but Quinn was sure of it. Leo had said &quot;We&quot; Which
included himself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo didn't need to
ask the students twice. They both quickly followed Leo closely behind
as the three of them ran out of the town and into the tunnel, not
once looking back, but his strange actions were starting to make
Quinn think. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a first for
him, the first time he had ever seen his teacher running away from a
confrontation. Up to this point in his eyes, his teacher had always
been someone that seemed unreachable. A force too strong to even
begin to imagine the real strength of. Even when facing the Dalki, he
had never acted like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whatever it was that
was frightening him or making him act like this, it had to be strong.
But if something was that powerful down here, then why hadn't Quinn
or the others come across it. After thinking about all the
possibilities of what could've happened, one thing was stuck in his
mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'No, it can't be, we
looked around the whole tower.' The tower they had just left form was
known as a vampire's tomb. And judging by the sight of the building
and what was left behind, it was a powerful one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Didn't you say a
vampire would need the blood of one of its family members? It's
impossible for it to wake up, right?' Quinn asked the system, but it
had chosen to remain silent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Answer me!&quot;
Quinn snapped in his mind. This time he was insistent and wanted an
answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry.&quot;
The system replied. &quot;I was just thinking about the
possibilities, but perhaps there was a chance we really did wake it
up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But how?&quot;
Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The only thing
I can think of is the blood crystal from before. Remember how I said
a blood crystal was quite rare, well that's because a blood crystal
is harvested from a vampires body itself. Just like how the beasts
contain a crystal inside their bodies, vampires do too. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Creating
weapons form these things became a taboo. It was a practice that
quickly became outlawed. The blood crystals themselves weren't
illegal, but intentionally harvesting one form a body was. Of course,
we don't entirely know what is inside the blood crystal, but when
using it as a raw material to create a weapon, the first part of the
process is melting the crystal down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At just the
right temperature, the crystal will start to melt and turn into a
blood like substance. I'm afraid thier is a chance, that when you
inserted the crystal into the podium, it might have started that
process and woken up whatever vampire was deep in its sleep.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why didn't you
say something earlier than?&quot;, Quinn complained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought the
same as you at the time. That the crystal would be used to help you
get the weapon. You see when a vampire goes into eternal slumber, it
does so out of its own choice. In a way, it is a vampire saying it is
done with the current world and is moving on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;However, their
bodies are usually kept at their family, base or castle. This way if
they ever needed to call on those desperately in times of need, they
could do. When I saw that there were no vampires in this area or even
any inside the tower. I assumed that the vampire must have chosen to
pass on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Some tombs
often set trials for their family members, with traps and tasks. Once
these were completed, they would pass on their treasures to the next
generation. I thought that this person was just doing the same.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
had finally left the town. They had gone through one of the tunnels
into an open area with several different pathways. The look on Leo's
face looked a lot better. Once he had travelled through the tunnel,
he could no longer sense the strang force that well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was because of
his ability, it was strong, but he could only see the area he was in.
As soon as he entered the town, his view had widened, and he could
see anything. There was one thing that was troubling him greatly,
though. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The aura that he had
sensed was the same colour as both Quinn and Fex. Still, Leo didn't
want to take any chances finding out whether this person was friendly
or not. Just because they had the same aura as the two students
didn't mean they were close. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was easy for Leo
to select the path back, as he remembered well which direction he had
entered from, and he started to lead the two students out. Finally,
they were about to leave the strange city and everything that had
been found behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While travelling
through the tunnel, it started to slightly tilt upward with no end in
sight, and they were unsure how long it would take them to get out.
While travelling together, Quinn was still trying to digest
everything he had been told earlier. About the blood crystals and now
he had a few strange questions on his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If a family
member is unable to kill its own member, how would someone obtain a
blood crystal in the first place?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That is an
excellent question. Even though Vampires and subspecies are unable to
go against their creator, that still doesn't mean they are unable to
break the rules. Just like with every family, they had their fair
share of trouble makers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;One could
always ask another family to do the job for them, but it would leave
a sour taste in the mouth and would often cause grudges between
friends and such if this was to happen. As such a special group was
created, one outside the thirteen families. These were called the
punishers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Their duty was
strictly to uphold the vampire laws that were created by the 13
vampire leaders and the king. They were separated from the others.
They didn't make friends with any of the thirteen and didn't interact
with them other than to bring down harsh punishments.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;These
punishers, they must have been quite strong then, if they had to
force these vampire families to follow the laws,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, very
strong...&quot; When the system spoke these words, he seemed to drift
off a little. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are they still
around?&quot; Quinn asked, noticing the system acting strangely when
speaking about them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Unfortunately,
that is for you to find out at another time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had tried
pressing further as he did before. If the system gave in once, maybe
it could give in again and tell him more information, but he was
unsuccessful. The vampire world seemed complicated and strange, it
also seemed to have a very long history that he knew nothing about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system tried to
reassure Quinn that it was unlikely the blood crystal had woken up
the vampire from its slumber. Some of the events just didn't make
sense. Why hand over a blood crystal to a beast if they planned to
wake up at a later time? Were they just leaving everything to chance?
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although what the
system had said seemed possible, Quinn had a strange feeling that
they had woken up the vampire. He knew Leo wasn't acting that way for
no reason. This time rather than wanting to find out about it, Quinn
just wanted to get away from this place as soon as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the end of
the tunnel could be seen, and daylight was shining through. Both
Quinn and Fex never thought they would be happy to see the sun, but
they truly were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they both stepped
outside, they lifted their arms up, covering their eyes from the
sensitivity but also had a huge smile on their face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn seemed even
happier then Fex as he started to jump up and down on the spot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you that
happy to be free?&quot; Leo asked. Hearing the sound of Quinn jumping
up and down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Embarrassed and a
face flushed with red cheeks, Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, it's
just nice to see the sun again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason why Quinn
was more overjoyed than usual was because for the first time in a
while, when stepping into the sun, he didn't feel sick. He didn't
feel groggy or weak, and there was no system message. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ring had worked,
and now Quinn could live the life he once had without any
restrictions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys
continued to follow Leo back through the jungle. There were many
beasts still in the jungle, but thanks to Leo's ability, they were
able to avoid all of them and select the safest path heading back to
the shelter. Eventually, they had arrived where all the remaining
students were. They were staying out the shelter in the large open
space on the ground, getting taken care of by the other military
staff. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn!&quot;
Layla shouted as she got up and started running towards him. As soon
as she reached him, she gave a big old bear hug, squeezing him
tightly. &quot;I thought you might have died.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I told you,

behind Layla. As she let Quinn go, Vorden proceeded to give Quinn a
fist bump and also a pat on the shoulder. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking around Quinn
was also happy to see that everyone in their team was alive and it
looked like Peter was okay, when his eyes met up with Logan's, a big

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We need to do

noticed she was continually looking in their group's direction.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the students had

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A while before Fex
and Quinn had arrived at the shelter. All the students from the other
classes had been told to return to the shelter as well. This was an
order issued by Fay. Frequently, both Fay and Leo were being called
out to help the other groups, it was clear that this wasn't a Green
portal planet. Or at least not one that the first year students could
handle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Leo had gone
after Del's class and took longer than usual to return, Fay had
decided to make the executive decision to call back all of the
students to the shelter. The mission was an important one, and she
knew her superiors wouldn't accept this as an excuse, especially
after just one day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead, to minimize
the risk, the plan was to go as one large group while both Fay and
Leo would guide them. Rather than split them up via their homeroom
classes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They would cover
less ground this way, and the expedition would be a lot slower, but
it also would be safer this way. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the
students, when returning, were annoyed. Sure they had run into
trouble now and again, but in the end, no students had died. Only the
weak ones had been injured. They felt like it was better to get rid
of the baggage they were carrying. Why not just allow the vulnerable
students to return while the stronger ones continued to hunt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the other
classes had now returned apart from Del's and Fay was starting to
worry. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where are you
Leo, if it's something you can't even handle then we really need to
get off this place as soon as possible.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, I see
someone moving.&quot; A student shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A person had stepped
through the jungle like trees and were now standing on the open dark
soil of the shelter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first person to
arrive was Leo, and behind him, all of the students started to
follow. As the other group saw Del's group, sounds of gasps and words
of concern were heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you think
they ran into an advanced beast or something?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah right, if
they did it would be a lot worse then this. You have to remember
Del's class is one of the weakest class out of them all.&quot; What
the student said wasn't wrong. Del's class was considered the
weakest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Erin gone and
the only strong one left being Vorden, it was hard for them to place
the class above any of the others. Vorden's ability would only allow
him to copy the strongest of another class. In the student's eyes
that only made them even, and they still had plenty of other strong
students in their classes apart from one person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, they
thought like this because they didn't know how Vorden's ability
really worked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon, the students
regretted saying those words as the others started to realize
something. At first, they thought that Del's class had just been more
injured than theirs. If they had encountered intermediate beasts and
it took Leo a long time to get there, then it would make sense. But a
little while after, they noticed that no more students were coming
out from the jungle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The current size of
the class that appeared, was a little less than half. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where is
everyone, what happened?&quot; the students said concerned. Not for
the other missing students but they were more worried that if
something got to them, then they could be next. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students from
Del's class were taken in for further healing as well as to make an
official report, while Fay and Leo were to discuss what was to happen
next. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What happened
to them?&quot; Fay asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
they went off trail due to an advanced tier beast,&quot; Leo
explained. The look of horror appeared on Fay's face as her fears
were confirmed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry, I
already dealt with it before even meeting up with the class. As for
the remaining students, according to the teacher Del, they were all
eaten, and there was no chance the students survived.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
looked over at where Del was, he was currently barging his way
through the injured students and going to the front of the queue. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Out of the
way, don't you guys know how to respect your superiors and elders. It
was only because of me you guys managed to live in the first place,
and this is how you treat me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Leo
couldn't really see Del's actions, hearing his words made him feel
sick. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That man
doesn't deserve to be a teacher,&quot; Leo said as he clenched his
fist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This should be
fun.' Fay thought. She mainly knew Leo due to his feats during the
war, but hadn't seen him in combat much. After hearing how easily he
dealt with the Dalki, she knew the rumours had to be true. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Any chance to watch
someone so significant in combat was a good opportunity for her to
learn. Especially since she also primarily used a sword as her
weapon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Leo took another
step forward, he suddenly stopped. Before anyone else, he could hear
the sound of the leaves ruffling from behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like we
finally made it,&quot; Andy said as he appeared out of the jungle.
The group of travellers had arrived, but they weren't alone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For they had also
brought back Vorden, Cia, Layla, Peter and Logan. Inside the tunnels,
Logan had managed to regroup quickly with the travellers once his
scanner was working. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As an excuse for why
Logan had done his actions, he simply said that he was too afraid
after seeing the students dead and thought that a beast was inside
with them. Although Andre didn't quite buy it, he decided to let it
slide. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students were
the military's problem, not his. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like
some more of Del's class has arrived, maybe they aren't dead after
all and were just split up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay, and Leo hadn't
quite told the students what had happened to Del's class. The
students who had survived were still busy being interviewed and were
away from the other students, so they still had yet to hear from the
other students what happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the travellers
and students had walked out from the trees and vines, what followed
next started to cause alarm in the camp. For the large lion like
beast came out as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Beast! Beast!&quot;
Students shouted as they recognized the beast was a powerful looking
one, perhaps at the advanced level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Calm down!&quot;
One of the commanders who was looking after the students shouted.
&quot;That beast will do us no harm. It belongs to the Bree family.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing that
name, the students quickly began to calm down. By hearing the name,
they felt safe, as the Bree's where one of the big fours and their
powers were known quite wide. The ability to control beasts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the stripes
on both Fay and Leo's side, Andre knew straight away who were the
highest commanding officers in this shelter, he approached the two of
them and saluted at them out of respect. Fay did the same back, but
Leo had chosen not to do anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Leo, I know
you can't see, but this is someone from the Bree family, and they
just saluted you,&quot; Fay whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I know,
but one must earn respect. I do not know who this man is. I see no
reason to show respect to someone just because they carry a certain
name.&quot; Leo replied loudly, knowing that he could be heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I agree
wholeheartedly&quot;, Andre replied. &quot;Which is why I chose to
keep my name a secret from most, unfortunately, my ability is a dead
giveaway. Anyway, I believe these students are yours.&quot; Andre
said as he opened up his palm telling the students to go over to the
other side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia, had the biggest
smile on her face as she ran forward, towards the shelter and the
other students. While the others decided to remain hoping to hear the
conversation between these two powerhouses. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you&quot;,
Leo replied. &quot;Would you mind telling me where you found them.
Perhaps I will be able to search for others near the same area. You
have done enough, so there is no need for you to go out of your way.&quot;
Leo said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Andre and Andy both
looked at each other. They had suspected bringing back the students,
that something like this would happen. In the end, they had already
made their decision when coming here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually,
there is something we must inform you about...&quot; Andy said as he
stepped forward and handed over a scanner to Fay. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They revealed
information that they had kept secret from the military. The fact
that they had discovered an underground town. Not only that, but it
seemed like it was made from Dalki structure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They made excuses
while explaining. Stating that they knew the place was abandoned and
had been taken over by beasts, which is why they decided not to
inform or trouble the military with this information just yet. But
both Fay and Leo knew they must have been a deeper reason for doing
something like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Leo, both
Quinn, and Fex. They're still down there.&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then handed
over the altered scanner he had created to Fay as well. Displaying
the information he had found. &quot;Most of the students who were
taken by the plants seemed to have passed away. There is still a
chance that there are others, but I'm sure both Quinn and Fex are
still alive.&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing by Leo's
side, slowly fay was boiling up at what she had just heard from the
travellers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You...you.. I
can't believe you were hiding this from us. Do you know if you had
given this information to us beforehand, the students would have
never been sent to a planet like this in the first place? Because of
you, students died.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before she even knew
it, her fist was already flying towards Andy's face, at the same
time, she felt a slash going towards her arm. Images of her arm being
sliced off were seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly pulling it
back, she looked at her hand and could see it was still intact. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't be too

the hilt of his sword. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden and the
others were prepared for a clash between the travellers and the
sergeants. They were ready to help out Leo wherever they could. Other
than helping them find an exit, the travellers hadn't really done
much to help them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Quinn
was the one who had killed the beast. Also, they still remembered how
much in debt they were to Leo, for saving them from the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every one of the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The pressure
emitting from the two groups was immense, that even one wrong word or
act might make the already fearsome looming presence break out and
swallow them whole. In the case for someone like Peter and Vorden
they were able to handle such a pressure that coiled, however for
Layla and even Logan, it felt like they were about to be consumed by
the dangerous energy that was swirling around, it was only waiting to
be unleashed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are they
really going to clash?&quot; The students on the side asked one
another, some of them began to get anxious of a fight breaking out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It would be
silly if they did.&quot; Another student sneered, shaking their head,
&quot;After all this is such a small thing, no one would be willing
to start a war between a few missing students.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, they were
unaware of how Leo thought. He was a simple man, rather than thinking
about the bigger picture of what his actions would lead to, he
thought it was best to do what was right in the current situation. As
things came to him later he would continue to deal with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was how he
always was and continued to be. Right now the people in front of him
had put the students he was responsible for in danger. In the past,
Leo was a different man and he did think about things, perhaps
thought about them too much. To the point where those around them
suffered because of it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I won't let that
happen again.' Leo thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the others
thought Leo wouldn't do something, Vorden managed to catch a glimpse
of Leo's thoughts. He could see his fingers twitching slightly as he
held the hilt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'He's ready to
attack at any moment.' After sharing Leo's powers and interacting him
with theory time he did with Quinn. Vorden felt like he could
understand him a bit more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He tried thinking of
a way to perhaps calm Leo down. The world didn't need a civil war
right now. In the past, there were several civil wars before
Truedream came along. There were rumours that the Dalki were keeping
an eye on the humans, ready to attack at their weakest point, if
something similar were to happen again. Perhaps the Dalki would
attack even sooner than they predicted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Leo, when we
were down there, there was an incredibly strong beast. For now I
think Quinn and Fex are safe but I don't know how long they will
survive. They need help now.&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing these
words, Leo's grip around his hilt weakened, it seemed to have work.
He stood up straight and carried on walking past the group. As he
walked he purposely barged into Andre's shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey what do
you think you're doing! Can;t you at least show some respect, we
saved your students. We didn't have to do that and we could have kept
the whole thing a secret.&quot; Andy shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then pointed
towards his own eyes and opened them up. Where the pupils should have
been black, it looked as if his entire eyeball was a tint of grey.
There was no colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry but
I'm blind you see, I didn't know he was standing there. Fay I will
leave it up to you to do what you want with these visitors of ours.
Whatever you choose I will back it up when we return to the base.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that Leo
continued to walk into the jungle, while also carefully stepping his
foot over a large root going across the floor. &quot;Nearly tripped
over that one,&quot; he said whistling away into the jungle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Blind my ass.' Andy
muttered under his breath. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By this point, Fay
had already calmed down from her anger before. Doing or saying
anything would just be a waste of breath. So she decided to take the
political stance instead. Doing what was best for both pirates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you for
informing us of this information. Please in the future do inform us
sooner. This way we can avoid any future problems.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Andre bowed down to
her, before leaving with his group, with a sour taste in their mouth
of what they had just experienced. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden and the
others were revealed. All they needed to do now was wait, hope Fex
and Quinn could return safely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While walking back
to the others, Vorden started to think about what just happened. When
he first joined the military it seemed like they didn't care about
what happened to the weaker students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They allowed fights
to go on without intervening and it was almost as if the fights were
encouraged to happen. Even with the whole Duke and Peter situation,
it seemed like they were purposely trying to cause friction and
division between those that were weaker and stronger in the school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This did happen in
the outside world naturally and in school before it, however, the
divide never seemed to be as big as it was in the military school.
After hearing not only Leo's reaction, but Fay's reaction as well to
the students in distress and him thinking. Perhaps it wasn't the
whole military that was like this. Or there was also the option that
it was more because of the ones that were in charge. Their
connections seemed oddly close with the Truedream family, more than
they should have been. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After waiting for an
hour, finally, Leo had returned and this time he wasn't alone. By his
side was both Fex and Quinn. Layla had run up to greet them and the
others were happy to see them as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By now, all of the
students from Del's class had been checked up on. They were now
allowed to spend time with the other classes but news of what really
happened to the class while they were out started to spread and the
tension was felt in the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reality of how
dangerous this expedition was finally was starting to hit them.
Friends and students they had only talked to a few hours ago in the
morning, were nowhere to be seen and they would ever be able to talk
to them again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo and Fay were
busy discussing what to do next. Although they were of the same rank
Fay never felt that way and she decided she would agree with whatever
Leo had decided. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have made my
decision,&quot; Leo said. &quot;I'm going to cancel the expedition
and return to the academy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;
Fay replied. &quot;It's only been one day and not much ground has
been covered. Paul won't be happy with the decision. Can't we just
travel as one group and protect the kids. Judging from what the
travellers told us, the Dalki settlement seems to be abandoned.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No!&quot; Leo
replied immediately. &quot;When I went down there I could sense it.
There is definitely still something there and it's at least at the
power of a four spiked Dalki.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, Fay's
eyes nearly popped out from her skull. A shiver was sent down her
whole spine and her hairs were left standing on top of her arm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We would need
at least one of the generals here to try to deal with something like
that, and even then I don't think they would be much of a match,&quot;
Leo explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I understand,
if we explain this to Paul they should understand. They might even
remove every one of the planets and classify it as a red portal
planet until further notice.&quot; Fay replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She had actually
misinterpreted Leo's words. For Leo had said there was something down
there that had the same power as a four spiked Dalki. But she had
taken this to mean there was a four spiked Dalki. Only Leo knew the
truth, that the energy that was emitting from the being was one that
was similar to both Fex and Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Leo looked over
at the two students, a thought soon planted itself in his head, 'Is
there an actual threat right underneath our noses that is probably
far larger than the Dalki?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the students had
been covered, on the muddy open soil area of the shelter which stood
just before the jungle. Leo had told all of them there would be an
announcement to be made. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sure by
now you have all heard of the news that has happened to Del's class.
Because of this, we have decided to cancel the expedition and head
back to the school,&quot; said Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing the
news, some of the students felt a weight lift off their shoulders. No
longer were they in danger and had the thoughts of meeting such
things. The ones that were part of Del's class were even more
overjoyed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, this feeling
of relief wasn't shared at all by everyone in the crowd. Those who
had done well on the test so far and had run into no troubles started
to voice their concern. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What?!&quot; A
student complained as they looked around for support, &quot;But it's
only been one day! That doesn't make any sense.&quot; Why should they
go back? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stop being so
selfish!&quot; Another shouted back at them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like two
camps had emerged of those that wanted to leave and those that wanted
to stay. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Enough!&quot;
Leo shouted in a loud booming voice. His voice had projected so
loudly that some of the students felt like their eardrums would
shatter. They wondered how a man so small was able to produce such a
loud sound. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The chatter had
stopped but a single student still had his hand remained up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, young
one,&quot; Leo said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't mind
having to go back early but I do have a question. What does this mean
for our assessment? Who got the top grade, and how will our scores be
divided.&quot; The student asked politely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Your grades
will be decided by how well you have done so far. In the past,
usually those that perform well on the first day, then would continue
to perform well through the test. I know this might not be really
fair, but we will take this into consideration based on your
performance on future assessments and adjust your result accordingly.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As for Del's
class, they will have an exemption due to the special circumstances
they faced and will be tested at some other time. Now the winners, I
suppose at these types of events, we always like to promote those
that did best so the other students know who to look up to as role
models. I shall decide the winners right now then.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing Leo
say this, many of the students that had done well on the assessment
so far we're starting to get excited. They would straighten out their
clothes and make sure their hair was ready as they were to be called
up to the front. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay walked over to
where Leo was standing and tried to hand him over a clipboard with
the scores of all the students points that had been received from the
scanner. Instead of taking the clipboard, Leo pushed it away and
shook his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There is no

students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The winners

students weren't the only ones that seemed to be confused by their
names that had been called out, but so were Quinn and the others.
They hardly had the time to scan anything, and even when Peter was
underground he didn't use the scanner, because it didn't work while
they were down there. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How did they
get the top marks? Our group managed to scan around fifteen different
plants and 3 new beasts. Are they saying they scanned more than
that?&quot; A student complained with a frown. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They must have

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But for the students
that were part of Del's class, they knew that Quinn and the others
didn't have much of an opportunity to do anything. Still, they
decided to remain quiet. Many of them remembered Quinn's brave
actions in saving some of the students from the advanced tier beasts
and bringing them to their side. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though there
weren't any points awarded for this, they felt like whatever reward
his group was going to get, they deserved it. However, there was one
person in Del's class that didn't feel the same way, and that was the
teacher Del himself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He still felt a

while they were out. Del was even surprised that the two of them were
still alive. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's
impossible, there must be some type of mistake or some cheating going
on!&quot; Del remarked loudly. &quot;Those students, I checked the
scores on their scanner, and not only that, they had fifty points
deducted from their team due to an incident that involved breaking
one of my other pupils' arms.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students had
been called and arrived at the front, but instead of looks of
admiration and jealousy, they were all stared down with looks of
hatred. Cia, who still didn't really feel part of the group was

they would come out of this assessment with a top grade which would
do well for her future. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that everyone
understood. No longer did the students who were opposed to leaving

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no more

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean? These people have nowhere to go.&quot; Layla replied. &quot;They
probably spent all the money they had to move here. Even if the
military did allow them to use the teleporters and head back to
earth, they would only be made homeless with no shelter or way to
earn credits.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

from beast attacks.&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla remained
silent when Quinn said this and Vorden simply placed his hand on his
shoulder. They were both aware of the fate of these people. While
Quinn was a little naive. 'The government had helped him, when his

thought. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the dimly lit
room, with the torches of flames flickering. The man stood there
wondering about why would anyone choose to take the ring? Out of all
the items that he had left behind, it seemed strange. Any experienced
vampire at first glance could tell that it was the weakest of the
items that had been left and even the least valuable. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Maybe it had been a
mistake.' The man thought. Whatever it was, for now, the man was
thankful for he needed a new set of clothing. Once he changed and

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then walked over
to the other five podiums that were covered in the strange metal

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each one of them
went back into the ground revealing the pieces of armour that were

naked. Although through the gaps between certain parts, bare white
skin could still be seen, as he was still wearing nothing underneath.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The helmet allowed

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This will have
to do, for now, let's just hope I wasn't woken up in the middle of a
war. Perhaps that's why the person had left in a hurry after waking
me up.&quot; The man thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He continued to go
down the spiralling staircase, but he found everything a bit strange.
If war really was going on, why wasn't he hearing anything outside?
Soon though he had his answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When stepping
outside, he had expected one of two things. A parade of people to be
there to welcome him back or a big fight to be taking place. But he
saw neither of those things. Instead, all that was left was an
abandoned town. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When stepping out,
he could feel that there was no sign of any others like him in the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe my
senses have yet to wake up.&quot; He told himself as he continued to
look around at the buildings nearby. He searched and searched, but
there was nothing. A few beasts that sensed he was near scurried away
not wanting anything to do with the new presence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, he came
across something that looked a little interesting. It was a strange
human-sized beast that looked like it had been killed not too long
ago. The reason why he found it interesting though was because he
could sense strange energy from it similar to his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now why would
a blood crystal have been left behind with a beast.&quot; Seeing
this, and feeling the same energy of the beast. He started to think
maybe his awakening was an accident. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Somehow the blood
crystal he had left behind with one of his family members had ended
up in the hands of this beast. From the looks of the area it had been
abandoned long ago, but he still had no clue how long he had been
asleep for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was quite
possible that someone had killed the beast, taken the crystal and
then entered the tower unaware of everything that was happening. That
would also explain why they would choose to take the ring if they had
no clue what the other items did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Perhaps my
stinginess paid off in the end.&quot; He said, laughing to himself.
Before going into eternal sleep, his closest aid, Steven, had asked
him to leave behind certain treasures. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had also asked
him to set up trials in the tower, but the man was too lazy for that.
When picking out items, he chose the ones that he felt were the
easiest to replace. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Steven was confused
by his actions. If he was going into eternal sleep anyway, it would
be best to leave his best equipment for those of the next generation
but once a cheapskate always a cheapskate. It was impossible for

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking back at how
it might be possible, there was also the chance that someone not a
part of his family or a different species had obtained the blood
crystal. He was now glad he didn't leave out powerful items.

find out.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

walk out of the town into the tunnels. The sword was now wrapped
around his back, using the chains to hold it onto his chest piece of
armour. It seemed like he had picked a tunnel at random when walking.

eventually sunlight could be seen at the end. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A step was taken out
of the tunnel and into the sunlight. The man was surrounded by jungle
nature and the rays of sunlight shot through the trees and leaves.
They were touching both the skin on his hands and the open area on
his face. However, unlike with Quinn and Fex, there was no reaction
for the man. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; A
scream was suddenly heard coming from his right. Immediately, without
thinking about it, he started to dash in the direction of the scream.
Moving at an incredible speed, he was able to manoeuvre around
avoiding the trees and hitting away the branches and vines that would
block his path. </FONT></FONT>

see a little girl just by a river, but she wasn't alone. A large
snake, nearly four times the size of the girl, was up on its body

but there was nowhere left for her to go, as the river was behind her

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were Multiple
advanced tier dinosaur plant beasts. They were the same ones that the
group of students had encountered and had so much trouble dealing
with. Three in total and all were using their vines grabbing and
pulling the humans off from the platforms and bridges in the large
trees above. They were making an effort fending off the vines with
the little beast equipment they had, and some were even using their
weak abilities. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But it was a good
idea to target the crystal to weaken it. The strange thing about this
type of action, was it was unusual for a beast to do this type of
thing. Ruby looked and looked to see if she could see what had

one and nothing. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students didn't
know what was going on as they waited in the room for the next

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Quinn, we
need to do something about Cia.&quot; Vorden whispered. &quot;She saw
your abilities, and not only that, but she also saw Fex transform
into that thing. I don't know why she hasn't told anyone yet, but
it's too risky for her to know.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, Quinn
couldn't agree more. It didn't matter why Cia was keeping it a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Before you

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at what

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Fex, we

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't;t
think it will be a problem, but I'll be honest with you. It's a lot
of information, and a lot of things happened. It will be hard to fill
in the blanks in her head if I do this. It might even cause her brain
to be slightly damaged, removing so many events.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't like
the sound of that. He hated the thought that perhaps he would have to
hurt people related to his matter just to keep a secret. Just because
she had the fate of joining Quinn's team, it was possible she would
now suffer for it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If it was down
to me, I would have removed her memories already. It's just too risky
Quinn. I know you by now, and maybe you feel bad for her. But if
humans find out about us, then that means the vampires will find out
about us, and I'm more worried about them. They will kill and
slaughter every person that knows of this secret to keep it hidden.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Fex said had

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sometimes, we

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It felt like what he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, Cia had
departed from the others. She had agreed to herself that she would
keep the other's secret, but honestly, the main reason was she didn't
want to even get involved with people like that. A group of students

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She herself didn't
like the military that much in the first place, so getting on their

She said a little startled as she moved back a bit. Still in her head
were images of what the student had turned into. Although she was
terrified, she quickly took a deep breath and calmed herself down.
There was a high chance that Fex just had a transform ability that
changed him into a type of muscular creature. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, she

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the usual
thing, and something Fex had done plenty of times while in school. He
just needed to wait for the typical response as her eyes would start
to grow dull and glow a slight red in return. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia seeing Fex's
eyes slightly change stepped back. &quot;Hey, what are you trying to
do to me!&quot; She shouted. As she said this, a few of the students
nearby had turned their head to look at what was going on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Huh, why isn't it
working? Am I too tired, No it can't be that.' Fex thought. 'Is her
mind strong?' </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't quite
clock on to what was happening at first since it was a feeling he
wasn't used to, but it was clear that she was able to resist his
powers. </FONT></FONT>

it?&quot; Quinn asked, unsure what had just happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No,&quot; Fex

like this has happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The influence skill
relied on one's charm skill. Up to this point, Fex charm had always
been higher and stronger than Quinn's. Fex had used his ability on
several students before and that included Level four ability users.
He never thought of the possibility of his influence, not working. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was, it
didn't matter how strong the individual was with their abilities. It
was all about how strong their mind was. There were some people Quinn
could imagine the influence skill never working on, such as Logan,
Vorden and Leo. These people were just too strong-willed. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, when

ordinary student? So why didn't Fex's influence skill work on her? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing the shocking
news that Fex had just failed, Quinn was busy pondering what to do.
There was always the chance that something like this might happen.
Perhaps a high level would see them, and they would be unable to deal
with it in the usual way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This thought was
always on the back of Quinn's mind. When he thought about it, again
and again. The ending that played out in his head was always the
same. He would have to kill them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was too risky to
leave something open, and while he was still in military school,
there was no chance to run away or escape. While looking at Cia,
images started to flash through Quinn's mind of the possible ways he
could do this, and a certain disturbing image entered his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One of him holding
Cia in both hands with blood dripping from his mouth. And, by her
neck were two puncture wounds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, why don't
you try to clear her memory?&quot; Fex said. This suggestion might
have seemed out of the blue before, but right now not so much. Fex
had his reasons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After witnessing
Quinn fight against the king tier beast, he knew that his speed was
already of that of a vampire Noble. Fex wasn't sure if Quinn had
evolved and gone to the stage of vampire noble just yet, but there
was still a chance his charm was stronger then his. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Coincidentally, when
Fex had made this suggestion, Quinn thought the same thing. Were his
current charm points higher then Fex's? He felt a great increase in
speed once his points had reached above thirty. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If his charm skills
didn't work currently against Cia. There was actually a good chance
that it could still work once his charms skills had reached above
thirty. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It could
work.. but if it doesn't...&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before he could even
make a decision, Nathan had already started to make an announcement. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Listen up,
everyone&quot;, Nathan said as he raised his hand in the air. &quot;There
is no need for the students to stay here any longer. Feel free to
head back to your rooms, and in the morning we shall inform you of
your schedule next week. We might even send a message out tonight so
keep an eye out for it on your wristwatch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As for all
homeroom teachers, I would like you to stay behind for now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Nathan
said those words, the doors to the portal hall were opened wide, and
the students already started heading back to their dorm rooms. They
were tired, defeated and just wanted to forget about the experience
they had gone through. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking around,
Cia had already gone. It was now night time, and the curfew for the
students to stay in their rooms was just about to pass. For now, he
would have to trust Layla to keep an eye on her, until he met up with
her the next day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the students
promptly left the room, and the teachers remained along with the
sergeants and Nathan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First, I would
like to tell you the whole planet has been evacuated of military
personnel for now. We will no longer be required to explore the
planet and a special ops unit will be sent in the future to figure
out whether the Dalki already has inhabited the place or not.&quot;
Nathan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, I don't
understand?&quot; Del said, a little frustrated. &quot;I thought we
all left because we knew the Dalki were there?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Our
information sources say they might have been chased away or even
something else. The reason why I am saying this, is due to their base
still being full of blue crystals. If the Dalki really had taken over
the planet already, they would have taken all the crystals with them
already.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Del didn't
have any wishes to continue the mission alone, he thought they might
still have a chance to complete it with Leo and Fay by his side. He
knew what the military was like; he had been with them long enough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because this
expedition had been cancelled early, they would soon ask them to go
on another one. If they had finished this one, they might have been
good for a whole year. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This
information would have been passed onto you all later on anyway.&quot;
Nathan explained. &quot;The real reason why I asked you to stay
behind is due to the upcoming inter military base event in two
weeks.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What does that
have to do with us?&quot; a female teacher asked. &quot;Usually, all
the second years take all the places, right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, usually
that is the case, but this year they have decided to do something
different. Apparently, there are a few strong first-year students
from the other military bases that wish to take part in the event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So this year,
they have decided that each class must select at least one student
for the three main events. Ranged ability tournament, Fighting
tournament and the crafting tournament. You all should have a list
ready for me by the end of the week of who you think will
participate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Paul has
stated that this inter military tournament is an important event, so
you must select your best. If your students do well, this will
reflect on you, and you shall be rewarded for it. Not all of our
positions are based on strength, and soon one of our oldest sergeants
will be retiring. Does anyone have a list of the current ranking of
students?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing what Nathan
had just said, Del started to have a slightly worried look on his
face. Not only did the students think Del's class was one of the
weakest ones, but the teachers did as well, and Del was aware of
this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In his head, he was
trying to think just who to pick for the event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A soldier from the
side walked up to Nathan and handed him over a tablet. On the tablet
was a list of every first-year student with a score beside their
name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, well,
this is a surprise.&quot; Nathan said. &quot;It seems like Del's
class has the most top-ranked students currently.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, his
jaw nearly dropped to the floor. How could it be, he thought, then
suddenly. He started to remember what had just happened. Leo had
awarded the group with the most points for the outing. That group
belonged to his class, not only that but in the last assessment,
Quinn and his group didn't do too bad either, scoring around the
mid-level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With top scores in
one and middle scores in the other, it positioned Quinn's group and
teammates relatively high on the current ranking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I shall be
expecting some good things from you.&quot; Nathan said as he looked
at Del. &quot;Now go get some rest everyone. I will update you with
what is to happen tomorrow.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At another military
base, it seemed like the group of teachers were having a similar
meeting. However, this one was a lot more formal. All the teachers
had gathered in a meeting room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were a total
of ten teachers, including the sergeant that sat at the head of the
table. One of the teachers was sat upright, stiff and still listening
keenly to every word being said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Does everyone
understand?&quot; a relatively large fat man said at the front. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;
Silver replied the quickest and was most responsive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why can't you
guys be more like her.&quot; The man said. &quot;Not only does she
always look stunning in the morning, but she works hard and is
responsive and she's the new one. Keep this up.&quot; The man then
turned off the presentation as he left the meeting room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other teachers
followed, leaving the room one by one, when a male student named
Justin noticed that Silver still hadn't left from her seat. She had
been in the same position the whole meeting, and even with it having
ended, she stayed there firm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Silver
the meetings over are you coming back?&quot; Justin asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver turned her
head and her silver hair with strands of black as tossed across her
face. As Justin saw this, he felt like he was watching one of those
shampoo commercials in slow motion. Everything seemed to slow down as
he appreciated her beauty. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry my
mind was on something else.&quot; Silver said as she stood up from
her seat and walked straight past Justin out of the door ignoring
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Justin called out. &quot;Maybe I can help, do you need anything?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Silver lifted her
hand and wafted it about in the air. &quot;I don't think I would even
ask for your help with boiling an egg. Just stick to teaching.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she walked off,
her head was still filled with one thought. In the meeting they had
mentioned the torment was coming up, there every single base would
travel to base one to participate. The largest military base of them
all. Here, she would finally meet the person she was looking for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students had a
better sleep they did when comparing to the whole time they had spent
at school. They were exhausted from the trip and more than they
realised both mentally as well as physically. Although a lot of them
didn't like the military school they had to admit it was nice to be
back here. In terms of danger, it's one of the safest places they
could be right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Late last night a
message was sent out to all of the students stating that their
morning classes had been cancelled. At the same time, in the
afternoon, they would be required to return to their homeroom
classes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before anything
else, Quinn decided to make a stop just outside the girl's dorm and
was currently standing outside Layla's room. He had travelled there
the early morning the second he was able to leave his room. It seemed
like no one else had woken up yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A knock was made,
and he patiently waited until a drowsy looking Layla had answered the
door. She was standing there by the doorway rubbing her eyes with her
short pink pyjama bottoms and a shirt that didn't have the top three
buttons done up. It looked as if the shirt was barely hanging onto
her, as the top of her shoulders could be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who's here so
early in the morning?&quot; She said as she finally stopped rubbing
her eyes.&quot; Quinn?... Wait! Quinn!&quot; She shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly, Layla
grabbed her shirt doing her buttons up as her face had gone bright
red. If she knew who was coming to the door, she would have been
better dressed then this, but it was too late, and Quinn had already
seen her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Regaining her
composure, she wanted to redirect the attention back towards Quinn.
&quot;Do you need something, it must be important if you came this
early?&quot; When asking the question, she took a look at his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Noticing that while
she was flustered and worried about the situation, it hadn't affected
Quinn at all. He didn't feel embarrassed by what he had just seen,
and the situation seemed to only be awkward for her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I didn't realise I
was that unattractive.' She thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although that wasn't
the case at all. When Quinn had first seen her at the door, the first
thing he thought was she had quite a nice body, showing more skin
then he should have been able to have seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was,
ever since turning into a full vampire, even though the feelings were
there, it was as if they felt suppressed. They didn't show out on the
surface. There were a few times this happened to him before, such as
when he was scared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For certain
situations, he thought it was quite helpful. When going through the
whole ordeal with Peter, and seeing him eat the human flesh, he
believed it was the only thing that had gotten him through it.
Otherwise, he might have never been able to sleep again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other situation
where it had helped was during fights. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before when fighting
as a human, the adrenaline would get to him. His hands and body would
start trembling before the fight had even begun. Still, just as some
feelings were suppressed others seemed to be amplified, and one of
these feelings was anger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were a few
occasions when he felt like this feeling had wholly consumed him and
taken over. Of course, he had this happen as a human. When one was so
angry, they didn't even know what they were doing, and their body
acted before they did. Only now these angry episodes seemed to be
happening more often. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Things that wouldn't
have bothered him so much was starting to grate on him. Like the shop
keeper, and when Cia had stabbed him with her spirit spear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peeking his head
slightly through the door, he started to look around if he could see
Cia. In the room, he could see a bundle of quilts all rolled up and a
person inside fast asleep. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did she do
anything to you last night?&quot; Quinn whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then walked
forward and closed the door slightly behind her as she shook her
head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We didn't
speak much before she was a team member. Honestly, it's pretty much
the same as she said before. We still talk to each other casually,
but didn't say anything about what happened on the trip at all.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this, Quinn
didn't know if it was a good thing or a bad thing, was she just
trying to pretend everything didn't happen? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you don't
mind,&quot; Quinn asked. &quot;Would you be able to get her to come
here now, say I need to speak to her about something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla walked up to
Cia's bed and planned to try to gently wake her up by rolling her
backwards and forwards, but when she was just a few steps away from
the bed, Cia said... </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm awake, you
don't have to wake me up.&quot; She took the quilt off and sat
upright. Unlike Layla, she was already in her military uniform rather
than her pyjamas. She then looked Layla in the eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's one of
your friends, right?&quot; She said. &quot;I'll speak to them, but
please... come with me.&quot; When saying these words, Layla could
feel they were genuine, and there was a slight fear in them; it was a
normal reaction after what she had seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When getting off the
bed and walking towards the door, without asking, she forcefully
grabbed Layla's hand. She practically dragged her with her to the
door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn could see the
two of them holding hands and didn't know quite what to make of it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I was
wondering which one of you they would send to come to talk to me.&quot;
Cia said. &quot;But I guess it would make sense for the so-called
leader they all follow, to come to speak to me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Leader?&quot;
Quinn replied strangely. He never saw himself as the leader of the
group. That position, he felt like belonged more to either Vorden or
Logan. They were the ones making the decisions most of the time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason why Cia
had come to this conclusion was it seemed like whenever they were
planning stuff or talking. Everyone in the group would always
naturally ask Quinn for confirmation. It was as if Quinn didn't agree
with it, then they wouldn't go through with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if he didn't
feel that way, it was clear he was the natural leader of their group.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ignoring what had
just been said, Quinn decided to continue with what he wanted to do.
He wasted no time and immediately activated his influence skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, Cia
could see the person's eyes in front of her glow red, only this time,
something was drawing her in as her mind seemed to drift away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Noticing what was
happening, She clenched her left fist hard and was free while the
other hand was holding onto Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was in
the middle of using his skill, he could suddenly smell something
sweet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The drifting feeling
was no longer felt, and Cia's mind was back where it was once again.
When looking towards the direction of the smell, Quinn noticed that
Cia's hand was dripping blood. She had managed to dig her own
fingernails into the palm of her hand to cause an immense amount of
pain. Redirecting her mind somewhere else, causing his skill to fail.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The action didn't go
unnoticed, and even Layla was impressed. One would have to have an
extreme will power to be able to hurt themselves to the point where
they would bleed. The normal reaction for a human was to not hurt
itself. Even the agents at Pure would struggle to do something like
this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Again you guys
tried doing something to me&quot;, she said as she backed away, now
clenching Layla's hand even tighter. &quot;Look, if it's about what I
saw, I won't say anything. I don't know why you are hiding your
abilities and your power. The only thing I will say to you is, don't
threaten me. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know
who you think I am, but I'm not like people you have met before.
Remember I'm keeping your secret. So if I need a favour from you
guys. I'll be coming to you.&quot; With that Cia slammed the door
shut and Quinn was unable to get the last word in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe it
didn't work now, but I felt something&quot;, he said. Quinn could
feel that it started to work, but her mind was just a little too
strong as she was able to resist his charm skills. If he was to get
his Charm points over thirty, he was confident he could remove her
memory. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia hadn't told
their secret so far, even though there were plenty of opportunities,
for now, he would just have to keep an eye on her and trust Layla to
make sure she didn't say anything. Still, he would prepare himself
for a plan B. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the room,
Cia's heart was beating at an incredible rate, and Layla could feel
and see this too. She was wondering why it seemed like Cia trusted
her so much. She was just a part of Quinn's group as much as anyone
else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Cia then looked over
at Layla and gave a big smile. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Do you not even

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the first Job

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A knock was heard on
one of the doors in the VIP dorm area, and while waiting for Logan to
answer, Quinn started to look around the place. The area around them
covered the same size as the area of the boys' dorms just underneath.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Roughly two hundred
and fifty students were living below. So it made Quinn start to
wonder just how many VIP students were possibly at the school. The
rooms were far larger, but still, whenever, Quinn came up here, he
never saw anyone come out from their rooms. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It made him think
that maybe most of the rooms were empty or they just liked staying
indoors all the time like Logan. Maybe there were some students they
still hadn't seen or met that were just as strong as Logan and
Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While in the middle
of his thought, Logan had opened the door and immediately pulled
Quinn in by the sleeve before shutting the door behind them. To his
surprise, Peter was already in the room as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't sleep,
remember?&quot; Peter said, seeing that Quinn looked confused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't mind
him,&quot; Logan said. &quot;He was just helping me along with my
research.&quot; When looking at Peter, it seemed like he was more
being used as a human vending machine. In his arms, he held multiple
sandwiches and drinks and was just standing there in one place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he didn't know
any better, he would have thought Peter's master had been Logan
rather than himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'When did the two of
them get so close?' Although this wasn't a bad thing. It was good if
Peter could listen to others without the need for Quinn to use his
blood or force command on Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan had quickly
gone to one of his workbenches, where it looked like he was analyzing
something. He placed a strange looking digital monocle on one eye and
had his tool glove on the other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what did
you want?&quot; Logan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I actually
came to give you a gift...&quot; As Quinn said those words, he
stopped midway. When walking over to the bench, he had spotted that
Logan already had what Quinn was about to give him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently, on the
workbench was the blue crystal, it looked identical to the one Quinn
was just about to give. The crystal was placed in a strange device
and had multiple wires and crocodile clips attached. Information was
being processed from the crystal to the computer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After placing the
crystal down by Logan's side, he let out a big sigh. &quot;I should
have known you would have taken one already.&quot; Quinn remarked and
proceeded to ask, &quot;Well, what is it? Have you figured it out
already?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan spun around in
his chair and lifted his monocle from his left eye. It was slightly
red as if he hadn't blinked for a long time while inspecting the
crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not 100
percent sure but I can tell you one thing. These crystals radiate and
give the same energy as a beast crystal.&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, but
there were thousands of them underneath the planet. Is this the first
time something like this has been discovered?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then proceeded
to pick up the crystal. Quinn handed him and replaced it with the
other crystal. After confirming that both of the crystals were indeed
the same type, he began his explanation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't think
so, I have a little theory of mine you see. I always found it odd
that the military was so concerned about conquering the beast planets
before the Dalki did. It didn't really make any sense to me. Sure the
beasts could be used to make better weapons but why the need to beat
the Dalki to the punch? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think that
the military doesn't just want these planets for the beasts but quite
possible for these crystals we found as well. Maybe these crystals
are also the answer to where do the magical beasts come from in the
first place. They don't mate like normal mammals. We have confirmed
that much.&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You said the
crystals were like beast crystals, do you know what they do?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That will be
part of my next phase, when I find out more information I'll come
tell you. Thanks for the second crystal. Honestly, I was afraid of
melting the only crystal I had down, so this will be a big help to my
research. Oh by the way, did you find anything in the tower that
might be interesting?&quot; Logan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since coming back
from the portal outing, Quinn had never mentioned he had gone to the
tower. He was always amazed how Logan was able to guess things, and
after lying to him before it felt a little harder to lie to him
again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked down at
his hand and saw the ring, in truth, the only thing he had obtained
from the tower was the ring. There were other items, but he didn't
get any of the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I only got
this beast ring,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;There was other stuff there,
even a strong looking sword, but we were unable to get it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went on to
explain further about specific details to Logan. He didn't say it was
a vampire tomb, but did talk about the blood crystal he had in his
hand and how it got taken away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a shame
about that blood crystal, that might have also helped us out with
these blue crystals as well,&quot; Logan said as he went back to
inspecting the blue crystals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking around the
room, Quinn spotted the VR machine. He hadn't used the one in Logan's
room for a while now, especially since Logan gave him the stick that
allowed him to connect to the private servers from any of the VR
capsules. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, you don't
mind if I use that, do you?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan wafted his
hand in the air, not even saying a word. There was no need to ask
Logan anymore if he could use it. There was now quite a bond of trust
between everyone in the group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had experienced
a life-threatening event together, and that always seemed to bring
people closer together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After entering the
VR pod, Quinn logged into the private server and was now in the white
training space. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[System skill:
Shadow eater] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time,
when unlocking a skill, there was no information on what the skill
could do or it's effect. When trying to use the skill, it was the
same result. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before he could use
the system to activate the shadow skills, and this was the same with
his blood skills. He would only have to think of the skill before
using it, and his body would slightly start to react on its own.
After repeating this a few times, Quinn got used to the feeling of
each action and eventually was able to perform them on his own
without the system's guidance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This made the timing
of the skills a lot faster and the flow better. There were some
skills that took more time to do that with, such as the Daze, and
influence skill which he still relied on the system for its help. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So when he had
unlocked the Shadow eater skill, he had assumed the same. Only this
time, when trying to use it, nothing would happen at all, and with no
description of what the skill did, he was at a loss. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the game and
room, he repeatedly tried everything he could with the shadow.
Imagining in his head what the skill would be and would try to
initiate it using the shadow. After a couple of hours of trying
though he felt like giving up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System, why
can't I activate this skill, it's unlocked, right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Once again, I
don't really know. Remember I wasn't the one that created the system,
I only helped design it.&quot; The system said. &quot;However, I do
think there is a way you can still learn it. The only thing I can
think of is to find a teacher. Another person who uses the shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Although,
there might not even be anyone that knows how to use the shadow skill
that is alive.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Other than skill
books, this was another way one would be able to pass down skills to
others, by teaching and showing them how to use it. Family members
and originals would often do this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean by that?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, the
system had decided to remain silent about his second question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Isn't the
shadow an ability only compatible with Vampires though? Where the
hell would I find a teacher for that, especially if you're telling me
there all dead. Does that mean I will never be able to use this
skill!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was a little
frustrated at the situation he was in. The skill had cost him one of
the rewards he had obtained for completing the quest. Also, by being
the most expensive shadow skill to unlock in his system he thought
that it would be something amazing. Something that might even greatly
increase his power for the next outing or even if unknowns were able
to come after him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

to be given a class with such weak students?&quot; he thought. He
knew there was a low chance of his class performing well and rather
than that being a reflection of himself, he felt like fate had just
given him a bad hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next, he decided to
sort the list by where the students current ranking was via points.
This was based on the two assessments that had been done so far. The
list drastically changed after that. Shifting Quinn, who was right at
the bottom, to near the top of the list with the rest of his
teammates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A part of him wanted
to select Quinn for the fighting event to see how far he would go,
and hopefully would learn his place, but he knew the management team
would think he was crazy for selecting a level one student to fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A thought then came
to his head, an idea that the upper management couldn't disagree
with. Not only did Del have to pick three participants, but he also
needed to decide three substitute places for the event. As long as he
had some type of reasoning, then it would be fine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, the
classroom door opened, as the students started to filter in. It had
just passed midday and the morning off the students were able to
enjoy had come to an end as they were told to head to their homeroom
classes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When everyone sat in
thier setas thier was a heavy atmosphere. When looking around, they
noticed that many seats were left empty, empty form those who had
died. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del quickly closed
the hologram. The teachers were allowed to know the rank of everyone
in the class, but the students were not. Although many of them
already had an idea as they could see how well others had performed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once everyone was
seated in their seats, Del stood up from his desk and started the
class. &quot;All right, everyone, there are no lessons for today, but
the reason why you have all been called in, is due to the upcoming
event. Not all of you will be taking part in it. But, there will be
duties given to each student to prepare support for your school and
military base.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del then started to
read groups of names in the class, telling them each what their duty
would be for the event. Some were in charge of creating decorations
and banners to support their base while in the crowds. Others were in
charge of helping with supplies and bringing food to the event, and
there were even more roles given to the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No one was really
interested in this, as everyone was wondering just who in their class
would be selected for the three upcoming events. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And finally,
it was a tough decision, but now I will announce who will be
participating in the upcoming three events.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Excitement was
filled in the room. A Lot of the students had an idea of who would
get selected for the fighting tournament, but for the other two
events, they had no idea. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First off, for
the fighting tournament, I have decided to select the highest ability
level and also one of the top-ranked students. Vorden Blade.&quot; As
his name was called, Vorden stood up, so everyone was able to see who
had been called and selected. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were no
complaints from the other students as they felt like this was the
expected result. Other than Erin, there really wasn't anyone as
skilful as Vorden. They had all seen him that day in the hall fight
his way out of a tough situation, only using Layla's ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Next up, for
the Ranged event I have decided to select Layla Munrow.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing her
name, she didn't immediately stand up. She thought there must have
been some type of mistake. Yes, her main weapon was a bow, but there
were others in the classes that were more skilled than her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike when Vorden
was picked, some whispers were going around the room, as they weren't
quite sure why Del had decided this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can see
there is some confusion. The reason Layla has been selected is
because of her ability. It matches well with her weapon. As you may
know, the event differs slightly every year. I believe her versatile
skills with using the bow will come in handy. Not only that, but she
is currently one of the top students out of the first years in terms
of points. This could only be possible for those that had at least
some skill.&quot; Del explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although there were
quite a few students who still disagreed with Del. They did feel like
his reasoning made sense. Still, several of the students who
contained ranged abilities were looking in her direction. They
couldn't help but feel for some reason a certain group of students
were getting special treatment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After getting the
most points for the portal outing, and now even taking two of the
places in class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Finally for
the crafting tournament. I believe there is only one student in our
class that is currently in the crafting club, correct? Benny Li shall
be the one who will take part in the crafting tournament.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The crafting
tournament was for those who mainly planned to become a blacksmith or
a type of tailor in the future. Their abilities usually complemented
them in the forging process of creating great weapons and clothes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was rare to have
an ability that would match this, so they were quite hard to come by
and highly sought out by not only different factions but the military
as well. Quinn was lucky that he had found Logan to create the suit
for him. Otherwise, he would have had to go off and search for a
forger like Benny. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, though,
he knew he would have to search for one of these people in the
future. If he wanted to carry on getting stronger. For him, he could
rely on the shop for now, but the top equipment in the world needed
to be created by top-class forgers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was a little
upset that he was unable to participate in the event. He remembered
Nate who he had met in the VR game had mentioned it multiple times.
Quinn was also interested in facing him and other strong opponents. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had the plan
with Vorden if anyone was ever to find out Quinn used shadow
abilities. So there was a chance he could have participated in the
tournament. Still, there was also the chance that there might be
other vampires there who would see his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Day by day, Quinn
could feel himself getting stronger, and it was only a matter of time
before he would be able to protect himself from the threats around
him. The problem was his friends, he needed to get even stronger so
he could protect them as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now that all
of the participants have been announced for the event, it's time for
me to announce the substitutes. In case any of the participants get
seriously injured before the event, or back out and go missing. These
students shall take their place.&quot; Del explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For the Ranged
event, Silly Dundee, For the fighting event we shall have, Quinn
Talen and lastly for the crafting event, Sissy Rondo.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The conversation
between the students really started to heat up now, as one of the
names mentioned was someone who was well known in the class for being
a level one. Recently he had been getting a lot of attention as well.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Excuse me sir,
but why Quinn? Isn't he the weakest in our class?&quot; A student
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del surprisingly
came out with a response Quinn didn't expect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you really
think so? If we were to go by ability level then perhaps you could
say he is the weakest, but there have been reports that he has learnt
the martial arts taught by Leo quite well, and you all saw what
happened when that advanced beast attacked us. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn was the
only one brave enough to go in and try rescuing those students.
Besides, it's only a substitute. Rarely has a substitute ever been
called in to take part or fight in the tournament.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Del
seemed to be praising Quinn and giving him compliments. Quinn didn't
like it one bit. He had seen Del's strange character actions during
the class's crises, and it didn't make sense for him to say these
types of things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If there are
no more questions, then you are free to spend time as you wish for
the rest of the day&quot;, Del said as he went up and left the
classroom. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of the classes
currently were doing the same thing as Del's class. Selecting
students for the upcoming events and giving them each a role. While
everyone was busy, inside the portal room, one of the green's portal
energy started to flicker and warp. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Two guards were
stationed outside by the door, while two guards were also stationed
inside to keep a watch. They noticed the strange reaction of the
portal. When something like this was happening, it meant someone was
coming through from the other side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both of them took a
step back and got into a fighting position, while one of them pressed
his hand up against his ear. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Stepping out from
the green portal was a human figure. It was a teenage boy wrapped up
in a hooded cloak. He looked dirty and beat, and his skin had been
darkened from the sun. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

a speaker. Although the sound from the speakers sounded strange.
Usually in a room like this one, the sound would echo as it bounced
through the walls. Instead, it was as if the sound was being directed
straight to her eardrums. She felt like she could hear the person who
was speaking as clear as if she was wearing headphones. When looking
around, Erin was unable to even see any speakers. </FONT></FONT>

it automatically drew to the side and opened. He then left the room

her back while watching Erin carefully. </FONT></FONT>

looked at Erin carefully, right now, she was still sitting on the
floor with her eyes closed as if to give off a relaxed look. However,
if one was to look at her face closely, they could see she was in
great pain. Her eyes were twitching, and the goosebumps on her arms
were already starting to show. </FONT></FONT>

was a soundproof room that actually went into the negatives when it
came to decibels. When inside long enough, one's senses start to get
disorientated. The sound of your heartbeat gets clearer the feeling

what is real from fake. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The thought in her
mind went back to seeing how mighty James was with his sword and how
he was able to kill the beast with a single swing. There were some

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, she started
to realize that closing her eyes and trying to focus the strange

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What's wrong with

she was no longer able to recognize her senses. As she couldn't stand
up, instead she started to think back to why she was here in the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Anger was always
another good fuel for her to fight through the pain. She thought of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Erin had
finally woken up, rather than her being in a white room, right now
she was in a pitch-black room and couldn't see anything. A soft
fabric was felt covering her eyes, so she assumed she was
blindfolded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like
you're awake.&quot; A male voice said from behind. The sound was
different from when they were in the white room, so she could assume
she had been moved. She also recognised the voice, although the man
didn't speak much. She could tell it was the same man who was with
her before, James. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The soft fabric that
was covering her face had been removed; still, her eyesight remained
almost pitch black. Whatever room they were in, there wasn't a single
spark of light. It was clear they were either testing her or still
didn't trust her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were always
rumours going around about how crazy members of Pure were, although
Erin didn't outright believe them as the news reports would be
clearly biased, but after a few first impressions of arriving at the
base, she was beginning to agree with what she had heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing that
was keeping her going was the fact that Layla, who was also a member
of Pure was such a kindhearted person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did she go through
the same thing?' Erin thought. The last room Erin was in it was
torture for her. After spending just 20 minutes, she could feel her
mind starting to crumble, but she held on for as long as she could. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room was there
for a reason, and it was clear it wasn't made just for her. It might
have even been used for training their own members. If Layla too had
gone through something like that, Erin was starting to change her
opinion of Layla being weak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She could imagine a
regular person only lasting about fifteen minutes. However,
truthfully she had no clue how long she had spent in there. When in
the room, a second felt like a minute. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although she
couldn't see anything, she felt that her arms seemed to be strapped
down and her back was upright. She was sitting on some kind of chair.
The sound of James shuffling around and moving could be heard, and he
seemed to be sticking on a sticky substance over different parts of
her body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
too much, this is a normal procedure for everyone who comes to us for
the first time,&quot; James said. &quot;As long as you tell us the
truth, you will be all okay.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of another
chair shuffling forwards was heard, and James was now sitting
directly opposite Erin in the dark room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I just need
you to answer me some simple questions, all you need to say is yes or
no. Understand?&quot; James asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Clearly, Erin was in
no position to give snappy answers, so rather than snap back like she
usually would, she complied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of a
machine to her right made a bell-like sound. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You are Erin
Hayley correct?&quot; James asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, the ding
sound was heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before answering
this time, Erin paused slightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time the
machine had rung twice instead of once. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When answering the
question, Erin had answered falsely on purpose as she had a suspicion
what the machine was, and now she had confirmed it. It was a Lie
detector. Usually, one would have an ability user come over and check
if they were telling the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since Pure didn't
have many ability users, it made sense for them to use technology
instead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, so we have
a smart one,&quot; James said. &quot;It wasn't like we were trying to
hide it otherwise we would have muted the rings, but if we catch you
in a lie, remember this will be bad for you, very bad.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>James then went on
to ask Erin more questions. Most of them were very basic questions at
first, mainly there to confirm she was who she said she was. Pure had
done their research as soon as Layla asked for her friend to be taken
in. They looked into the details and could tell her parents had died.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next set of
questions went on to confirm that she had just lost her abilities in
the Truedream incident. So far it seemed like everything was going
well and she indeed wasn't a spy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the information
was currently being recorded and being sent over to the older women
who stood outside the dark room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you the
only one that knows about Layla's true identity as a member of Pure?&quot;
James asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far, Erin had
almost been answering instantly at every question that had come at
her. For this one, she paused. If they were asking something like
this, this meant that Pure clearly didn't want others to know Layla
was there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, her hands
were tied, even if she lied they would know. The problem was she
thought about who would get the blame. Would it be Layla, or the
others that knew about her? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this moment, she
wished she could see the expression on James's face. Perhaps it would
have told her something about what they were planning to do to the
others. Instead, she started to feel the fabric folded over her face
once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When she was able to
see again, this time, she seemed to finally be in a room with some
sort of colour for once. The room was small, and she was currently
sitting at a desk. When looking around, it looked like she was in
some type of classroom that was filled with around thirty students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others sitting
at their desks were of all different ages, but most of them were
younger than Erin and looked like they would be in primary or
elementary school. Just at the back of the room, James and a few
other adults were present in the room as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When observing the
room closely, she noticed that there were no windows, and it looked

not the welcome he had expected. After being missing for a month or

showed him it wasn't the case at all. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Will you guys

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the way here, she
heard some information that the person who entered the portal was
claiming to be a student. If he was to show his student military I.D,
then they would have allowed him to pass over. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing
was... this turned out to be quite unexpected. When she entered the
room, she was half-expecting for the person who just returned to be
someone from the orange portal expedition. Maybe perhaps a student
who had been left behind, but instead, it was actually someone from
the original green portal planet from the first expedition. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only person who

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she pondered over

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's
right... But how do you know my name? I didn't think that you kept
that much attention on me,&quot; Pio responded with a slight blush on
his face. Hayley was a beautiful teacher and she was the only doctor
for the first year students. Even though she saw a lot of students,
she didn't really directly teach any of them. Out of the 500 names
around the campus, he was rather surprised that she remembered his.
This caused him to misunderstand and feel special about this
encounter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Is this student the
fake one? Or is the impersonator the one inside our base?' Hayley
gulped at this thought. She reasoned out that the one currently at
the school was most likely the fake student. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If someone was to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still... as a
precautionary measure, the student was cuffed with his hands behind
his back, a soldier escorted him off for interrogation. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, I
promise you! I'm really me! You can check my I.D card!&quot; Pio
started screaming, &quot;You can see that it's me on the files,
right?! You guys already have my picture! Why are you doing this?!&quot;
He continued crying out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's the

who looks exactly like you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the meantime,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being cuffed up
wasn't a nice feeling at all. Pio started wondering what on earth had
happened while he was away. Had the world suddenly turned into a
dictatorship during his absence? Was the whole place taken over by
the Dalki already? However, both of these couldn't be the case at
all. Otherwise, he would have heard all about it back on planet
Caldi. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I think I would
have rather continued spending all that time in the desert than be
treated like this...' Pio regretfully complained in his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What soon came after
made him change his thoughts. As soon as the doors to the supposed
interrogation room were opened up. He was greeted with a full meal,
desserts, and even a luxury bed in one location. He didn't know that
the school had such a place! </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Pio's eyes were
fixated on the food, he hadn't eaten a proper meal in days while he
was traveling through the desert. Luckily for him, when he came to,
he ventured off in a certain direction, and just when he thought he
was about to pass out and starve from hunger, he came across a group
of travellers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They escorted him to
a shelter nearby, however, the bad news was, the shelter wasn't owned
by the military, but a faction instead. After the travellers kindly
took care and fed him for a single night, Pio was left to survive all
on his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He worked hard
during his time at the shelter and gathered up as many credits as he
could. Eventually, he was able to buy a map. This was the moment more
bad news came, the distance between the shelter he was currently at
and the place he had to go was quite far. If he was on his own, he
still wasn't sure he could face the beasts he would meet on his way.
This was why he continued working hard and earning even more credits.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily for him, his
ability for being able to duplicate any type of beast weapon came in
quite handy. It allowed him to earn the required credits and
eventually hire an escort team quicker than normal people. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, he finally made
it back. But still... during that whole time, he never splurged his
credits on a good meal. Drool kept falling from his mouth as he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing the
sound of another person in this place, his eyes gradually averted
from the food as his head turned to another direction. He was now
staring at the second year general, Duke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What? Why isn't it
Nathan?' Pio thought. Usually, as a first year, all matters related
would be assigned to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, before we
let you tuck yourself into this nice meal, I need you to tell me
everything that happened,&quot; Duke asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Duke had eyes and
ears all around the school. It also included having some soldiers
grab information from here and there. The incident of what happened
in the portal room had reached him although Hayley had already
instructed that no one was to leak any of this information to the
students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The information may
have not leaked outside, but it still managed to reach Duke. For some
reason, his hunch was telling him that something wasn't right about
this situation, this was why he had an unusual amount of interest in
this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Perhaps the
infiltrator was related to Pure... Ever since they angered Truedream,
Duke had gotten the heat for that situation. He had a huge grudge
with Pure now. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The female who wore
white robes from before entered the room and did her usual job. While
questioning, she should be able to tell if Pio was lying or not.
After about thirty minutes of nonstop barrage of queries, Pio's mouth
turned dry from recounting everything that happened to him the last
month. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every single word he
said so far had been the truth, they even managed to confirm that he
was the real student. However, there was still one thing that
bothered Duke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So you're
saying that you never saw the Dalki? Are you really positive about
that?&quot; Duke asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My memory is
kind of a blur, honestly speaking, but I would have definitely
remembered a Dalki attack. So no, I didn't see the Dalki,&quot; Pio
responded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reports that
were mentioned back then didn't match up. Originally, they assumed
that the Dalki had completely killed Ben's group of five. Two of the
bodies were found nearby each other, and later on, two more bodies
were discovered. Although they were far apart from the rest of the
group, Pio was presumed dead at this point. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The original
speculation was that the three out of the five escaped the Dalki, and
that's why their bodies had quite some distance between them. Despite
their efforts, they were still killed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, now that
Duke thought about it more, the distance between where the bodies
were found didn't make sense. The Dalki should've been able to kill
both of those students in an instant. If that happened, then Pio
would have remembered such an event for sure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Maybe... perhaps the
deaths of the other two people weren't related to the Dalki at all? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you, you
may now enjoy your meal. Feel free to get comfortable in this room,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, did he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The little
mechanical spider was neatly tucked just underneath Peter's shirt
collar. It climbed up from below his sleeve and was now in the prime
position for it to listen and hear everything around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the spider
acted as a microphone, and at times, a small speaker. It was unable
to be used in transmitting any video footage. The other problem was
that the situation which just occurred was unexpected for Logan. He
was completely unprepared and never thought that something like this
might have happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the sound
recorded by the spider was sent to the computer in his room, he could
listen to it at a later time, however, that wasn't good enough. He
needed to be aware of what was currently happening. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily for him, the
soldiers who came to grab Peter did so just when classes ended for
the day. This gave Logan the opportunity to head back to his room as
fast as possible. As he was returning, he placed his other hand on
the watch on his wrist and sent out a message. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the message was
sent out, all of their group's watches started to light up. After
what happened with Truedream, Logan made sure that the adjustments he
made on everyone's watches were permanent. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The messages he sent

to Logan's computer in real-time. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once they saw the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In an instant, they

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Logan entered
his room, he immediately ran towards the computer and listened to the
spider's transmission. However, there was barely any sound so far.
The soldiers were only silently escorting Peter, all the while they
did this, they didn't say a word to each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's good,
Peter. We still aren't aware how much they know yet,&quot; Logan
muttered out. The next thing he had to do was check where they had
taken him. If things went bad, then they would perhaps be able to
come up with a similar plan with the one they did with Truedream. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After checking the
information and looking at Peter's trail, Logan slightly raised his
eyebrow. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now... why are

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter's tracks led
directly to the second year building. The school campus was mainly
composed of three main buildings with several smaller ones around it,
almost similar to the martial arts hall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It consisted of the
first year building, the second year building, and finally, a
separate building for the teachers and soldiers who worked as guards.
These people would often rotate in and out with the others from the
military base, in fact, this building was also the location where
important meetings would be held. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Logan was
busy thinking about the possibilities, people started entering his
room, the first one being Quinn. The door snapped open as he shot
inside at a nearly incredible speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can you close
the door?&quot; Logan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh… My bad…&quot;
Quinn flusteredly said. When returning to close the door, a few more
people entered the room. Unlike Quinn, they were sweating since they
rushed over as quickly as they could </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, everyone
who knew about Peter was present, this also included Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's good that
you're all here, I won't have to explain myself over and over again,&quot;
Logan announced. &quot;I was there in the classroom when the soldiers
suddenly took him. I don't know what for, but I think we already know
what it should be about. It's obvious why they would do this without
any warning. One of my spiders is currently attached to him, however,
we don't have any new information yet. There is one thing I find
strange though… they're currently heading for the second year
building. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both Vorden and
Quinn reacted at the same time, they said one name, &quot;Duke.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do we
do?&quot; Layla asked. &quot;We have to get him out of there, right?&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's observe
for now,&quot; Logan responded to her question. &quot;There are many
things that they could be accusing Peter for, we might have just
jumped the gun on this one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone was now
patiently waiting in silence for any new information that might come
from Logan's computer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see you made
it, Pio,&quot; Duke's voice rang out. &quot;Please sit.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before he took a
seat, Pio glanced around the room to see how many people there were.
This was perhaps in preparation that he could find a chance to escape
at one point. But rather than finding any possible weak links, he
instead realized that he was in a rather luxurious room. It was
somewhere he didn't even know that existed on campus. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Peter finally
sat down, Duke mirrored him across the long table. They looked into
each other's eyes without saying anything. Both men didn't stop
gazing into each other for even a second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're a
strange one.&quot; Duke's words broke the sudden tension. &quot;You
didn't bat your eyes away from me. It seems like you're not scared of
me at all, unlike the others. You seem to have similar traits to that
of a trained terrorist.&quot; He now had a large grin on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The old Peter would
have been shaking in his boots, his heart would've also beated so
loud that he couldn't even hear his own thoughts. However, right now,
he felt none of it. The only thing he was aware of were the
suppressed emotions of fear in his mind. He knew that he was in
trouble, but his body and face weren't showing any signs of it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me ask you
this, what's your date of birth?&quot; Duke started asking questions.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because it was a
simple question, Peter responded instantly. Duke then continued
asking similar questions like these. For query, Peter would perfectly
answer back like a machine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, he got
all those questions correctly,&quot; Fex spoke. &quot;It means we're
in the clear, right?&quot; When Fex looked around the room, he was
confused as to why everyone's face seemed to be even more concerned
than before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem here was
how quickly and perfectly he answered every question. Even to them,
it almost sounded like Peter was some trained spy asked to infiltrate
the school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well... if you
say you're Pio.&quot; Duke snapped his fingers as a signal, a guard
went outside of the room. A few moments later, another student was
brought in. &quot;Then who is this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man who was
brought in was the real Pio. When the real Pio saw a doppelganger of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No! Don't let

continuing to cover his eyes. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's wrong
with you?&quot; The guard said, gripping his arm even tighter. They
had been rough with him for the last few hours and still didn't treat
him like a student, instead, they handled him more like a captured
intruder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't you know

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Duke let out a sigh
before continuing, &quot;As you can see, the jig is up. We already
know that you're not the real Pio. You're most likely a spy since
you've chosen to hide your identity like this. My best hunch is that
you're using a transformation skill, we have the perfect person for
people like you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nathan looked at the
two students standing next to each other. They looked almost exactly
like identical twins. Although their body shapes were slightly

happened so far, if he wasn't aware of things, then he would have
guessed that they were actually twins. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A large bubble-like
shape started appearing from Nathan's hand. It moved and slowly
started covering Peter's body from head to toe. From another point of
view, it looked as if the bubble was slowly eating him alive. When
Peter was completely sealed in the bubble, he started feeling a
strange energy from inside his body. It made him feel as if he was
being drained. In just a moment, he fell to the ground. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What are we doing
right now? They already know he isn't Pio, we have to get him out of

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But how?&quot;
Logan replied. &quot;I hate to say it, but for once, I have no idea
how we can get out of the current situation. With Truedream, Peter
hadn't been caught and we knew that he was coming beforehand. This
situation is something we can't control. They already know his
identity, and if we try to help him, we would only expose ourselves.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After listening to
Logan's words, Quinn clenched his hand into a fist. Vorden, who was
right by his side, saw this. &quot;He's right. There's nothing we can
do.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back in the room,
Peter was still trapped in the bubble, drained of his energy. Keeping
in mind that there were multiple soldiers and two generals around
him, he processed multiple scenarios in his head. After looking at
things, he finally knew that there was no chance he was getting out
of this. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last words from
Duke's mouth had been heard clearly by everyone. By now, even Layla
stopped complaining and every single one of them remained motionless
in the room. They received confirmation that one of them was caught. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was always the
possibility of something like this happening. However, before getting
caught by the military, Quinn always thought that another student
would've at least got them first. He prepared for such a scenario,
but he wasn't ready for this one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Fight them, get him
out of there.' A voice seemed to be resounding at the back of his
mind. However, he kept his rationality in proper order. Quinn didn't
have the power to fight against the military just for one person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently, Peter was
left in the room, he was sitting down on a chair at the table. His
hands were still cuffed behind his back. Nathan and four other
soldiers were in there with him. However, Duke was no longer in the
room and went somewhere else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room was silent.
In the meantime, Nathan was busying himself with going through some
films of Peter in the past. He wanted to make sure that he didn't
misread the information he had. In fact, he was extremely sure that
Peter didn't have an ability in the first place, and had later been
given the Earth ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when Nathan used
his own ability to drain away Peter's MC cells, he realized that the
latter was actually using a Transformation ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he was still in
the chair, handcuffed, Peter continued looking around the room to
find an opportunity of a way out. Despite a small bubble being left
over around his hands, the energy he recently lost was already
starting to recover. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was for this
reason that a part of his body continued feeling incredibly weak.
Thankfully, it seemed like they underestimated Peter's true strength.
In just a short amount of time, he would soon be strong enough, even
with the bubble on him, to break free from the handcuffs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter glanced at the
guard closest to his right side. Once he broke the cuffs, if he
reacted quick enough, he should be able to kill him in one blow. Even
if he was attacked by the others, his body would be able to withstand
or heal any of their hits. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter also had
another trick up his sleeves. He had the ability to turn two people
into lesser wights. If he was to use this now, then there was a
higher chance he would be able to get out of this situation. However,
despite this plan in his head, there was one more person he had to
take in mind of. Nathan was still here. He was unsure of exactly how
strong Nathan was and what his ability did. And with Nathan being a
General at the military base, Peter was sure that he was strong. But
he had no choices left, this was a risk he had to take. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A portion of his
energy had now come back, and with a slight tug, he tested the cuffs
restraining him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait,&quot; a
small voice directly resounded in his ear. &quot;Don't do anything
yet, Peter. We still don't know what will happen to you, just remain
calm.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These instructions
were being transmitted by the small spider Logan had placed on him
before. Peter hesitated for a moment, trying to decide whether he
should listen to Logan or not, however, he felt like he could trust
him and cancelled whatever plans he just thought up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Since they got me
and Erin out of something like this before. They can surely do it
again.' Peter reassured himself with these thoughts. Unaware of what
was currently happening inside the room, no one had a clue what to do
next. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have to
start thinking about leaving the military base,&quot; Vorden broke
the silence. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;With Peter, or
without?&quot; Layla shot back with a question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Without, of
course. There's a high chance that they will soon start interrogating
him. By then, they'll link him to everything that has happened so far
and find out we were all involved.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we're
safe from anything like that happening,&quot; Quinn quickly
responded. &quot;I know Peter won't sell us out of his own accord,
and even if they did get that girl to question him, it still wouldn't
work.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How would you
know that?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex will back
me up on this, Peter is different now. One of the things that's
different about him is that certain abilities no longer work on him,&quot;
Quinn explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex nodded in
agreement while adding in his own words, &quot;He's right. A Wight is
unaffected by abilities that target the mind or body in some type of
way. They are also immune to poison, they don't sleep, and they don't
register a heartbeat. A Wight will never give up his master either.
If you're worried about them linking him to us, the only connection
you guys have is being his past teammates.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Even so, that
still doesn't solve our original problem,&quot; Layla continued
speaking, &quot;They're going to do something to Peter and will
eventually find out he's different. Don't you think that they're
already wondering why he has a different ability now? If they find
out about his healing capabilities, he'll be used as a lab experiment
for the rest of his life.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Layla just said
was one of Quinn's true fears. It was why he was extremely intent on
hiding his secret in the first place. The fear that he would be
locked up in a lab somewhere and be tested on... If that ever
happens, then everyone would say it was just fine because it was for
the sake of humanity, to help them defeat the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There are a
few possibilities. Luckily for us, this world still has an order of
civilization. I still don't know how far that will get us...&quot;
Logan started speaking. &quot;Even if Peter is to be moved to a
research lab or such, or maybe even treated as a terrorist who works
for Pure, he will still first have to undergo a trial. I'm pretty
sure that this so-called 'trial' would only be for show. The Generals
and Truedream have their own ways to speed up the process and put the
judge in their pockets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What this
does, however, will give us a little bit more time. I guess that
before Peter attends the trial, an investigation will continue in
public or behind the scenes. He'll probably be temporarily placed in
the underground dungeons. We aren't sure how heavily guarded it is
for now, or if we have the capabilities in breaking him out, but we
can use this opening to save him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just let this
one go, Quinn.&quot; Vorden's words sounded like an ultimatum. &quot;You
already saved him once before. Forcing a rescue operation would get
us all killed. I'm sorry to say this, but if you decide to go through
with it, I won't be helping you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room fell silent
once more after Vorden spoke. The reason being was that the others
kind of agreed with what he was saying. The dungeon was a place where
they kept undisciplined students and soldiers, there was a higher
chance it was heavily guarded because of this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whatever you
do, Quinn. I'll be there with you.&quot; Fex said as he slapped him
on the back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking around
the room, Quinn could see the expressions on their faces. No one else
volunteered to help, even Layla who really wanted to participate in
the operation, didn't do so due to the simple reason that she felt
she was too weak. She herself knew that by forcing herself to do it,
she would only hinder them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay,&quot;
Quinn responded back. &quot;I've decided... it's best not to save
Peter right now. It's too risky and is none of your
responsibilities.&quot; While saying these words, something in
Quinn's mind tugged at him, telling him to try and save Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Despite deciding not
to go through with the plan, it still kept reminding him. 'Is this
connection from before? It seems like I can fight it a bit now.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Quinn
had now grown stronger, it seemed like he wasn't going to let his
emotions get the better of him. It might have also been the fact that
Peter wasn't in immediate danger right now. He knew that the military
would most likely not kill him, but instead, perhaps torture him. He
had convinced himself that Peter wasn't going to die anytime soon,
and this was how he stopped himself from trying to save Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's the
right choice.&quot; Vorden agreed with him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Was it really,
though?' Quinn's mind asked this question. For some reason, he had
this huge feeling of guilt looming over his head. If he knew he made
the right choice, he shouldn't be feeling like this. But right now,
he felt nothing but miserable. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, another
sound emerged from the computer. It was a low and familiar tone. Duke
was talking. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Duke had left the
room, leaving both Nathan and Peter together. Although the two
generals didn't get along, they knew they were both working for the

had gotten to his position in the army. If it was just restraining a

leaving the room was to contact Truedream himself. Below the Special

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the video call,
Jack was sitting in his chair, and in the backdrop, the whole city
that was directly under his control could be seen, showing through
the glass windows in his skyrise building. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, you know
me better than that,&quot; Duke replied with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly something
grabbed Jack's attention. Ever science leaving the military base, he
hadn't forgotten what had happened at the school, how the Pure's
group had made him look like an idiot. Not only that, but he
remembered the fear he had in that room; for some reason, the
sleeping ability from one of his trusted guards didn't work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had put him in an
unfavorable position, and there was the chance he could have died
that day. Before, Jack wasn't too bothered by Pure and the politics
between the military and them. Now, he had a significant interest in
getting rid of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have found
the boy known as Peter. He was one of the students that Pure said
they had safely in their hands. It turns out he never left the
academy and was using a disguise ability.&quot; Duke explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Excellent, and
what about the girl?&quot; Jack asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have reason
to believe Pure might have genuinely taken her. My theory is that the
student known as Peter was initially working for Pure all along. They
must have hidden that he had the Disguise ability waiting for the
perfect opportunity to use it. It would then make sense why the
sleeping agent didn't work on him if they managed to prepare
something beforehand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have to add,
though; this is all just speculation. We are unable to confirm
anything; for some reason, it seems our truthseeker is unable to use
her ability on him. Perhaps Pure is advancing quicker then we think
and have been able to find something to stop abilities.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The military knew
Pure's goal, so they gathered that they must be working on some serum
or vaccination that would target the MC cells. So far, there had been
no sign of a result. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Duke's line of
thought was that if they couldn't take away or get rid of their
abilities, maybe they could create or alter a person who was able to
block them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Have you
reported this to Paul yet?&quot; Jack asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I did as
you asked and spoke to you first.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good, if Paul
were to find out about this, he would want the student to go through
the court process. If that happens, he might eventually shift them to
the research department, and from there, he will be out of my hands.&quot;
Jack said. &quot;I believe the punishment that will be given to the
student will be too light. I have an idea that will not only be a
fair punishment for Peter but will perhaps allow us to punish those
pure members... &quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack went on the
details of the plan and recounted the outline to Duke. The two of
them needed to be on the same page. After all, technically, Duke
worked for the head general Paul. Doing this would mean he was not
doing his duty as a soldier and had decided to help out an outsider
like Truedream, who technically didn't work for the military but only
closely cooperated with them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The tough decision
was for Quinn and others to leave Peter behind, and two members of
the group were struggling with this significantly. In Logan's room,
they continued to track Peter's movements, and it was as they
expected, Someone had taken Peter to the underground dungeon. Or at
least that's what they suspected as the spider's signal was lost, and
the area last seen was the dungeon entrance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day had
arrived, and there seemed to be two members of the group struggling
with Peter's disappearance the most. One of them being Quinn. He
still felt a little responsible for what was happening to Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the System
had reassured him that Peter was fine. Taking that if Peter was hurt
or in trouble, due to the current distance between the two of them,
Quinn would be able to feel it if Peter was being tortured or hurt. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Logan's was
a different case. He was in his room, working on one of his gadgets
at his workbench. He had been working through the whole night, and
usually, he worked late, but this was later than usual, and he didn't
even take a break. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was as if he was
trying to get his mind off something. Finally, after hours of work on
some gadgets, he decided to take a break. Lifting his robotic

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, that was
hard, Peter, would you pass me a sandwich?&quot; Logan asked with his
hand held out, but he felt nothing in his hand after waiting a while.
He turned around in his chair and looked at the spot Peter would
usually stand at. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back in school,
lessons had resumed as usual. Quinn didn't know why, but he seemed to
be avoiding the others and was starting to hang around with Fex more
often. Even in his room, the conversation with Vorden felt a little
awkward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had helped
him out wherever possible, and it was the first time he had decided
not to. It wasn't his fault, but Quinn didn't know how to deal with
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Besides, he had his
problems he was trying to solve. The voice in the back of his head
was starting to get louder as more time passed. The voice kept
telling him to go against the school and fight them. Try to get Peter
out of there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He continued to
ignore this and went by his days as usual. However, Fex noticed this
strange behavior. He would often, at times, suddenly stop while
walking, grabbing his head. By now, Fex had already figured that
Quinn was the one who turned Peter and assumed that the pains must be
from whatever the school was doing to Peter in the dungeon. For some
reason, Fex didn't quite believe that though. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The evening had
come, and the lessons were over. Some students were still outside the
school during this time, while others decided to relax in their dorm
room. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had stated
that he was going to play the game for a bit to practice. Hearing
this, Fex agreed to come with him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh.. darn,&quot;

something with him tonight. Maybe next time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's okay,&quot;
Fex said as he watched Quinn walk off, he knew something was up. It
was clear Quinn had said that to get rid of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These strange
actions led Fex to act. Whatever Quinn was doing, it was clear he
didn't want others to see. Once the two of them were a great distance
away, Fex decided to follow him. The distance between the two was
quite large, and the reason for this was because of the smell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another vampire was
able to smell another. They had a stronger sense of smell and could
tell the difference between them too. Still, their eyesight was far
better than their sense of smell, so although Fex stayed a distance
away, he could still see Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While following
Quinn, it had led him down a hallway, where he could see him talking
to a student he had never seen before. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly, the two of
them left the corridors and started to head outside. Finding this all
too strange, Fex continued to follow the two of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, they
left the school grounds and entered the woods by the park nearby. Fex
quickly realized what was going on by the strange movements the
student was taking. He was under the influence of Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, when they
reached a secluded spot, Quinn looked around to see if there was
anyone he could spot. However, Fex was well trained in the arts of
spying and following someone. The experience and training he had were

now. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It took him a whole

was to get stronger. Luckily for Quinn, there was a quick way to do
that. It was consuming as many different types of human blood as

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It took a while for
Quinn to find somebody, as he had to make sure that they met certain
conditions. The student would have to be on their own and at night
time. It was so nobody could see what he was doing, and when taking
the student out of campus, there was less chance of someone spotting
him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second condition

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know my
answer, why even bother asking,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;We have
to lose on purpose. Many people will be watching this fight, and if
we display anything out of the ordinary, then a lot of attention will
be on us. It might even cause the family to get involved.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next few days
leading up to the inter tournament, everyone was off doing their own

had held to her word, not reporting to any of the teachers or higher

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When consuming
blood, Quinn would take a minimal amount, this would make sense if he
were trying to test out the taste of the blood, but if they found one
they would like, they would often store it in a flask like container.

like, they would spit it out in disgust. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other thing was,
Quinn was quite a young vampire. Usually, their sense of taste for
blood was quite basic. It was only the older vampires who, after
hundreds of years of tasting different blood types, started to get
obsessed with. So everything he was doing didn't make any sense. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing these words
come out of Fex mouth caused nearly every blood vessel in Quinn's
body to freeze. He couldn't help but utter, &quot;What did you say?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess you
really didn't know huh?&quot; Fex replied, scratching his head,
knowing that this was going to be a tough one to explain, &quot;Think
about it right, sometimes when we drink blood, there's this rush that
comes over our bodies, there have been studies where it was observed
that it increases a vampires strength by about ten percent. That's
why I always carry a flask around, not just for healing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The problem
is, blood is like a double-edged sword for us; the more often we
consume it, the more we crave it. From an early age, Vampires who had
close ties to the head of families were taught to resist blood. At
first, maybe we can't go on for more than two days without blood, but
eventually, we can build up a resistance to it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The vampires
who have been alive for hundreds of years have gone through this
process strictly, and now some of them don't even require blood
anymore. However, there are occasions where when they go into battle,
they will consume some, and make a note that not all vampires chose
to go down this path. If one does drink blood after resisting it for
a long time, it will only cause a small setback before they are back
to normal again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Still, the
same can also happen the opposite way if you keep drinking blood like
this for pleasure. Eventually, you will become an addict, craving
blood, and not even be able to quench your thirst. To put it in
simple terms for you to understand, you would become a conscious
Bloodsucker.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The explanation had
Quinn slightly worried. He had been drinking blood quite regularly to
increase his strength. In fact, if there was an opportunity to
consume blood, he would take it because it allowed him to grow
stronger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn first got
his vampire powers, he decided to only consume Layla's blood as and
when needed even though he enjoyed the taste. He was afraid of this
very thing from happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, once he had
obtained the system AI, his original fears started to lessen.
Whenever he had a question about vampire matters or when something
might do him harm, the system would step in to stop and explain
things to him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Undoubtedly, the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system had a
long pause, and Fex wasn't saying much either. Fex thought that Quinn
might have been consuming even more blood whenever they weren't
together. Such as during training sessions and in the classroom.
Perhaps he was having a hard time taking in this possibility. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Enjoying the taste
of blood was fine, but no one wanted to be a living conscious

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What!?&quot;
Quinn shouted in his head but was also cautious about making sure Fex
was unable to hear him. Although he was able to keep his thoughts in
his head, his body slightly jolted with anger, which didn't go
unnoticed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First of all,
the word you used, trust, I find it strange. In the first place, I am
nothing but a system who chose to help you. Not once have I ever told
you a lie. I may have hidden some things from you, but without me,
you would be more or less in the same situation anyway.&quot; The
system replied, now with alteration in his voice, showing that he was
annoyed at Quinn's words. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing the system

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;To be honest,
without me, you would be far worse than you are right now. I never
told you or suggested that you go out and consume the blood of your

chose not to get in the way of that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system was
right; he had never told Quinn to do this. Due to his desire to get
stronger, he had resorted to this without bothering to determine if
there were any consequences. He had been relying on the system too
much when he should have stuck to his research. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, don't
worry about it too much. It is not too late, and that's why I chose
to warn you,&quot; Fex said, trying to break the weird atmosphere.
&quot;All you need to do is stop drinking blood until you feel that
thirst again. Then stretch that limit until you can't give in. Do
this repeatedly, and each time you should be able to resist a little
longer. Simple, right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex did make it
sound simple, and although the process of restoring blood was simple
for any vampire, hardly any were able to last longer than a week
without feeding, while Fex could last two weeks at such a young age. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most vampires
weren't able to extend their times between feeding because of the
excruciating pain and willpower needed for it. To put it into human
perspectives, it would be similar to starving someone of food who was
as addictive as a drug. It would be hard for him to concentrate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the time between
recovers grew longer, so did the pain. There was a point which
certain top-tier vampires would pass where the pain no longer
bothered them, which was why they no longer needed blood. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn was to do
this, though, he thought perhaps he would have an advantage. The
system would inform him when he was hungry enough and allow him to be
careful not just to pass the point where he would turn into a
bloodsucker. Things that others had to perfectly time and feel, Quinn
would be able to cheat it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't drink
blood for a couple of days and see what happens. That way, you'll

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

perplexed with what to do. He didn't have a couple of days. Soon the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day had
arrived, and everything went on as usual. There were now only two

wanted to get his charm stats even higher and later test it on a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he could get to
the point where his influence skill could work on an adult, then
maybe he would be able to infiltrate the dungeon unseen and free

was already on Quinn's finger, but after seeing the message, he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was only because

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Storing blood was a
challenging task even if he wanted to keep it for later. It was why
he was so thankful for the blood bank. Unfortunately, the blood bank
worked in a way where he would have to over consume on blood. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only when his HP was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing Quinn's
actions had put a smile on Fex's face. Many vampires didn't heed this
warning and continued to consume blood. Eventually, the Punishers
needed to step in and deal with the problem. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't very
pleasant for him as he wished he would have known about this sooner.
Right now, he had 95 points of HP. Which meant it would take 95 hours

building up a resistance wouldn't have been much of a problem. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of thin air, a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At this point, the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only reason why
they would want Peter to be in this fight was if they thought Pure
was watching. If they cared about Peter that much to save him from
the clutches of Truedream, then perhaps they would do the same again
at the Inter Base Tournament. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was, it
wasn't Pure who had saved him last time. They didn't care about Peter
at all. What this also meant was Peter wasn't out of the woods yet.
The fighting tournament would be the stage to show all of the Pure
members what they were doing to their colleagues. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan and Fex were

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, Quinn
would do anything to rip the black sack off his head, and the problem
was he really could do it. He was a hundred percent conscious of what
was happening around him. The main reason for this was to see the
color of the portal.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it were a white
portal, it would indicate they were traveling somewhere on earth. If
it were a colored portal, he would know they were going to a
different planet. Military base One was different from the other
military bases.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was where the
current government would reside, hiding behind the most skilled
personnel. It was also where the leaders would gather and was the
only base that didn't have a school campus.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The place and
locations of all military bases were kept secret to the students
during their time at the academy. This was to stop information from
being leaked outside. This included the smaller factions on the
outside world that didn't quite agree with the military's doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This is why Quinn
thought it would make sense for the main military base to perhaps not
to be situated on earth. However, he wasn't able to find out, or at
least, not today. Because before he could think of any way, his body
was lifted and chucked into the portal to the destination on the
other side.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Over at one of the
other military bases, a school was also getting prepared to send all
their students to military base One. Nate was at his desk, sitting
down, staring blankly at the pieces of paper lying in front of him,
while the other students were busy packing away their things and
getting ready for the Tournament.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You are still
looking at that thing!?&quot; Sam said in shock as he came over and
placed his bag on the desk and sat nearby Nate. &quot;We are going to
depart any second now, and you still haven't even packed your things.
Get up already!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know, I
know,&quot; Nate replied, &quot;But I think I might have found the
person we were looking for.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You mean the
Blood Evolver? I'm not saying he isn't in the Tournament, but I do
doubt your slow brain, which is good only at fighting, was able to
figure out something like that. Go on then, tell me how did you reach
your conclusion?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate then lifted the
sheet of paper that he had been staring at all this time. The paper
showed a long list that contained all the names of students who would
be taking part in the Inter Base Tournament.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the paper's
contents, Sam's eyes widened in shock, and he quickly moved his hands
to put the papers down on the desk, grabbed his bag, and placed it
over the list of names. &quot;Are you damn crazy?&quot; Sam
whispered, &quot;How did you even get the list of names of all the
participants.&quot;&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems like
fate wanted me to find them, Sam. When I came into the classroom
yesterday night, it was on the teacher's desk. Somebody must have
misplaced it.&quot;&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Slapping his hand
against his forehead, Sam was starting to wonder how Nate had ever
made it this far in life. Although, this side of him was why the two
of them were good friends and got along in the first place.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That doesn't
mean you can just take it for yourself. Oh well, too late now, as
long as we return it, it should be okay and may save us from all the
trouble we are going to face,&quot; said Sam. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Anyway, after
finding the list of names, I started to do some research. I contacted
students from the other schools inquiring about each of the
participants in the fighting tournament. The main thing I was looking
for was a student that fought with gauntlets.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Afterall,
there aren't many students who chose to do battle with such a
close-ranged weapon. Not only that but based on the information we
have, we know he is a first-year student. This narrows down our
suspects even more.&nbsp; After asking around, it seems like there is
only one student who fits the bill. He goes by the name of Larry
Star. This person is our Blood Evolver. He has to be. No… I'm sure
of it, I can feel it in my gut.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the start of the
explanation, Sam was actually onboard and was starting to be
impressed. Was this really the same Nate he had grown up with?
However, hearing those last words caused Sam to take a step back a
bit. Whenever Nate had a gut feeling about something, it was always a
hundred percent wrong. He decided to shrug his shoulders and let Nate
go on with his wild thoughts. It wasn't hurting anyone this time, so
there was no harm done.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, but what
about the Zombie? You were interested in him as well, right?&quot;
Sam asked.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;About that
one, I have no idea; we might not even see him since the nature of
his ability is only to heal. I agree that He was strong in combat,
but on a tournament scale while not in the game. The fights might not
work out the same way.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam decided to move
his bag off the list of names. He then decided to grab the pieces of
paper and return it to the teacher's desk before she could enter the
classroom. While placing it at the front, Sam couldn't help himself
and take a peek at all the names on the list.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These names would be
of the people who would, in the future, control the world. What Sam
also noticed was by each of the names was a little number in
brackets. When looking at Nate's name, the number six could be seen.&nbsp;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Judging by this, he
could easily assume that all the numbers indicated all the students'
ability levels participating in the fighting event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You've always
been the underdog in these types of situations, but I know you'll
prove everyone wrong.&quot; Looking at the names, one could see that
Nate was one of the lowest levels in the fighting tournament.
Especially when looking at all the second year students.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nearly every student
that was participating was either a level 7 or 8 in terms of ability
level. Nate was the exception in this challenge. Using his high
fighting skills, he would be able to overcome the difference in the
strength of abilities. There was also a second reason why Nate could
compete on an even level with the higher ability levels; it was
because of his soul weapon.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although abilities
could be the same, soul weapons were often not. Even if two students
had the same earth ability level, their soul weapons would be
completely different. One could come in the shape of a hammer, while
the other may be a shield.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some soul weapons
weren't even objects themselves but were seen as an evolution of
their abilities. With how different soul weapons were between each
person, they would sometimes make a massive difference in power. In
this case, Nate's soul weapon would increase his power to the point
that it will allow him to fight them on an equal level.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was why Nate
was respected by the higher-level students and looked up to by the
low levels as well for overcoming that gap.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking through
the names, something had caught his eye, he was sure that Nate would
be the lowest level there, even out of the first years, but it seemed
that wasn't the case at all.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What? They can't be
serious! Am I seeing things correctly?' Sam brought his head closer
to the sheet of paper to have a closer look, but he wasn't mistaken
at all. 'One of the first years, they have a level one on her!. What
were they thinking? Are they trying to get him killed? It has to be a
typo, right?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When inspecting the
names closer, Sam also noticed that there were lines between all the
participant's names in the fighting tournament. He wasn't quite sure
what this meant, but if he was to take a good guess. It would be who
their opponents were in the first round.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Across from the
level one name, Peter Chuck, was another year one student who went by
the name of Larry Star, a level 6 user.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Well, what are the
chances of that? I guess you might be able to go against our
so-called Blood Evolver after all. It should be an easy win for him.'
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Sam put the piece
of paper down, he looked up and realized that all the students had
suddenly gone silent and were staring in his direction. Finding the
whole thing strange, he tried to turn away when a slender body came
in his view.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, would you
like to tell me what you were doing with that piece of paper?&quot;
Silver asked with a smile. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The temptation to
peek at the colour of the portal was killing Quinn. However, he
decided to keep the black sack covering his face, after all, it
wasn't worth it. There was no need for him to worry about where the
1st military base was. Actually, he didn't really know why he was
getting a little obsessed over it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't like he

in his entire life. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second his body

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was actually
surprised that when passing through the portal, this strange
sensation didn't wake up the other students. This also meant that the
gas, or whatever was used to knock them out was strong enough to
disable them. As he thought into it a bit more, he was kind of
surprised that it was able to place Fex asleep. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Having decided to

opening his eyes, the only thing he could see was the color black.
The thought of the world being taken over entered his mind, this

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of a sudden, the
sound of something coming from behind them could be heard. The
pressure head was released and the light started shining through.
When the students turned around, they could see the sides of whatever
they were in opening up, and a metallic platform stretching out. It
eventually hit the floor, there was a good ten meters from the
opening before the platform had touched the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When stepping
outside, they finally noticed that they were in the 1st military
base. However, it didn't look all that different from theirs. It was
more like a city with certain buildings surrounded by construction.
There were mechs out and about, transporting cargo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The main difference
was the size of the base itself. It was nearly two times more than
theirs. However, the most shocking thing they saw so far was the sky.
Although it could be seen, it looked slightly different from what
they were used to. This vague feeling continued bugging Quinn,
however, he couldn't figure out why. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What he did notice
though, was the shine going all across them. The entire city seemed
to be encased in a large glass-like dome. And around the edges was a
high rise wall, making it impossible to see what was outside of the
city unless one was in an airship. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the students
looked behind them, only did they realize what type of vehicle they
were in. It looked like a submarine on wheels. The thing was
extremely huge and it had sixteen wheels the size of houses on its
side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was starting
to realise what was making all that noise from before. The
teleportation device must have transferred them somewhere, and later,
they needed to be moved via the vehicle in front of them. </FONT></FONT>

platform, once it was finished, it immediately headed off in a
different direction. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Mike, Nathan, and
Duke went out to greet another soldier. They later followed him until
they reached a train stop. Since the base was large, getting to their
destination by foot would probably take them a few hours. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While riding the
train, the students were able to see more of the city. It seemed like
the city itself was split up into different sections. And between
each section was a small barrier. Each of these sections had soldiers
focus and prioritise on different things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At one of the
sections in the city, they witnessed mechs being built and tested. In
the next one, it looked like they had beasts in captivity and were
doing some type of experiments. And next, it seemed as if it had
combat focused classes, and so on and so forth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They then went and
passed the city centre. It was a large dome-like building which
looked like a miniature version of the base itself, it firmly stood
at the centre. The top of the dome had a flower-like design that
looked similar to a poppy. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The army decided to
use this symbol after the first war. Most of the battles between the
Dalki took place on earth. There was a lot of blood spilled on the
battlefield. Once the war was declared over, something strange seemed
to happen. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This building was
the world government's headquarters. It was where the Eight Head

make their decisions. It was like they were in control of the world. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The train continued
moving past the city centre and eventually went towards the back of
the city where it seemed a little less busy. They passed another
small barrier of some type, and many mechs and soldiers seemed to be
standing guard. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They entered another

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After they exited
the trains, they could finally see where the event was going to take
place. It was an arena that was large enough to host Olympic games
right in front of their eyes. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was quite round
in shape, almost looking like a wheel on its side. And became it was
made of glatherium, it had a slight tint of blue in its color. What
surprised them the most, however, was on top of the arena stands,
seven large buildings looked to have been built into the thing,
making it look like a crown. </FONT></FONT>

had a clear open glass that was tinted black. All of them faced
inwards towards the arena. On the front, there were large numbers

spoke to them. &quot;Because you're the first ones here, when you

the area. The buildings here are like hotels, you are allowed to

them in the hangar, but as they were the first ones to enter, they
were shortly separated once again when they moved in the large

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking about this,
Layla thought about whether or not she should try to get Pure
involved. She knew that Peter wasn't a part of Pure. Still, if she
were to put a word to her mother, maybe she would help her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although this
thought didn't last long, Layla was currently a rank 100 agent, and
she had already called in a big favour from her mother last time. It
was unlikely her mother would risk the whole organization for this
once again. Knowing this, she was too afraid even to ask. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After about half an
hour of the students exploring the training area, they were called
and huddled up once again. This time they were divided into groups
based on the events they would be participating as they were told
they would before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan was placed
into the crafting event, Layla into the arranged event, while Peter
into the fighting event. The three of them were now separated from
Peter even further. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each group was led
to a different section of the room where a soldier would explain the
event's details to them. The three main events had the most
participating students since one student was required from each
homeroom class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ten students from
the first year, and ten students from the second year. With the seven
schools participating, that meant there were 140 students per main
event. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the fighting
event, while the soldier was busy explaining the rules to everyone,
everyone's attention was focused on one person. Peter, who still at
this moment had the two guards by his side. It was clear to them that
he must have been such a dangerous event, but now that Peter was
closer to all the participants, they could spot something on his
wrist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fact that his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students wanted
to question it and ask, but the soldier upfront was busy explaining
the rules and processes to everyone, and they knew better than to
interrupt. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike the others,
Nate wasn't too interested in the mysterious figure. He was far too
busy trying to figure out, out of all the participants here, which
one was Larry. The Blood Evolver. Right now, the students didn't have
their best equipment, so it was hard for him to tell. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And that's
about it for the fighting event rules. Now what we will do is go
around and take a stage name from you all. This name will be used to
announce you before you enter the arena. Try to pick a name that will
strike fear and be remembered by all. After all, not only military
personnel will be watching this. Many top tier factions have been
invited to this event as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter thought about
it for a while. He too could tell the soldiers around him were of a
higher class than their military base. If there was ever a chance for
him to escape, he should have done so when he was alone with
Truedream and the other soldiers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, he
couldn't escape, and he couldn't even imagine Quinn and the others
thinking of a way of saving him. If he were going to be killed after
this anyway, he would go down using all his strength. He wasn't just
going to throw away the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This meant they
would find out about his incredible healing abilities. If he were
made into a lab rat, he wouldn't tell them anything about Quinn. He
still had respect for Quinn for saving his life, and after betraying
them once, he wouldn't ever do it again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you sure
about your ring name?&quot; The man asked. &quot;It's sometimes nice
to have a name related to your ability or one that's easy to
remember?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

equipment</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the event
starting tomorrow, the students were free to do what they wanted for
the rest of the evening. There were no strict requirements and even
no curfew for the students, which was a first; it truly did feel like
they were on a week trip to watch a grand event. Never had they ever,
been treated like this before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only rules that
were put in place were for students to not leave the arena. Not that
it was possible anyway. The arena was located in a separate part of
the city, and the only way to get to it was via train, which would go
through several different barriers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When stepping off
the train, they all noticed the mass amount of security. Leaving this
place seemed to be a lot harder than breaking in. However, after
living in luxury, they really felt like there was no reason for them
to try to leave anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three boys,
Quinn, Fex and Vorden had left the hotel room and headed down to the
top of the arena. Just like the guide had said, the top of the arena
was mostly flat and filled with all kinds of stalls manned by staff.
There were coffee stalls, food places, Vr games and all sorts. But
what interested most of the students was the equipment stalls. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of these sold
different types of beast gear and armour, as well as items that would
go hand in hand with certain abilities while fighting. The boys
decided that they would walk around the entire circle, looking at all
the shops before committing to buying anything. It was always
horrible when one would see something they liked in a shop, only to
find something better or cheaper in the next one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go on then,&quot;
Fex said with his hands behind his back. &quot;What do you think of
the sudden change?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Quinn asked, confused. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What? Do you
mean you can't tell? All of a sudden they're pampering us up, nice
hotel rooms, shops, equipment and no curfew.&quot; Fex replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn hadn't really
thought about it before. He just felt like the group were currently
on a school holiday like they used to have at school. Near Christmas
times and other holidays, schools tended to be more relaxed. The
world, even the military world, couldn't be all work and no play,
could it? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like you
figured it out.&quot; Vorden said and motioned around, &quot;The
whole thing is a ploy for the students. They show and give them a
taste of what life is like at military base one. Some of the students
will start to think maybe choosing to join the military, rather than
the faction isn't so bad, especially if they can have a life like
this. I hate to say it, but there's always a motive behind
everything.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three boys
stopped to take a break and were looking over the edge, down at the
arena floor. There looked to be thousands and thousands of seats, but
none of them were for the students. The students would be watching
the fight, either from the top platform they were currently on, or
from their hotel rooms. There were multiple large display screens
every once in a while, so it wasn't like they would miss anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The seats themselves
were for all the different factions from earth and other planets.
They had been invited to see the future generation display their
power. It was a good chance for the military to show the world that
it was necessary to continue to draft teens into the army. As well as
for factions to try to get future talent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe it's a
good thing I'm not fighting,&quot; Vorden said. Although these words
were spoken quietly, with Fex and Quinn's hearing, they both had
heard him say these words and were wondering what he meant by them as
he looked at the crowd of empty chairs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike them, Vorden
was a talented individual. An original from a good family but not one
of the top four. If he were able to display his strong skills and
abilities, he would easily be scouted into a top faction, Quinn
thought. His life would be set, and he would have nothing to worry
about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So it was strange to
see Vorden kind of relieved that he wasn't fighting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
continued walking and having already done a full circle, they had
decided which shops they wanted to stop by. For Quinn, what he truly
wanted was a strong or better set of gauntlets to use. His
intermediate pair wasn't good enough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, when
looking around, there was barely anything above the intermediate
level. Most equipment at the advanced level or higher would have to
be hunted for, or one would need to hire travellers to gather the
materials for them. There were a few items, but none that matched
what Quinn was looking for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, with only
boots and gauntlets, there was no harm in increasing his equipment in
other areas, one of these being defences. The best piece of equipment
to get would be a type of chest piece. This covered the largest area,
and when using his inspect skill, Quinn also found it gave him the
most defence points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When walking around
this time, they noticed a lot more students around than before. This
was because all of the other military bases had arrived by now, and
they too had left to explore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They entered a few
shops and Fex was the first to buy some items. He purchased very
small knives that were as large as a finger and had a little ring
just underneath the handle. Knowing that he had a string ability,
Quinn could imagine Fex being able to do great things with those
weapons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden didn't
purchase anything but instead stared at two short swords on the wall,
seeing this, a memory came back for Quinn. He had asked Vorden a long
time ago if he was to use a weapon, what type of weapon it would be,
and he had replied with a pair of short blades. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden didn't use
beast weapons much, as he seemed to favour elemental abilities and
most elemental ability users didn't really use beast weapons, but
still had plenty of beast gear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After inspecting the
stats of the swords on the wall, and looking at the intermediate
blades in Quinn's system shop, he realised how much better the
weapons in his shop were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't buy
those,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Don't worry; I'll get you something
nice soon.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden smiled, and
the three of them left the shop to head off to the next one. The next
shop was a place for Quinn. A shop that mainly focused on armour. A
piece had caught his eye before. An intermediate piece that was dark
blue in colour and had a silver trim going around the edges. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After selling his
crystals from the last portal expedition, he now had a total of 4440
credits to spend. The intermediate piece on the wall was 4000 credits
so he had enough to spend, but was hesitating whether he wanted to
clear his bank like that for one piece of equipment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were similar
priced items in the shop, but this was one of the only ones that
increased all stats. Other pieces of equipment, improved strength
more, while giving no stat points to other areas. But this was well
balanced. On top of that, it had the most defensive points of the
lot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn still hadn't
figured out what defensive points really did. His gauntlets gave him
eight while his boots gave him four. If he had the chest piece on top
of that, he would have 32 points of defence. Even if he didn't know
what to do, the higher number was always better right? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After thinking about
it for long enough, he finally had decided to go through with the
purchase, reaching out his arm. As his fingertips pressed against the
right chest plate, another hand was seen pulling it from the other
side. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student to his
left, turned and looked at Quinn. The first thing that he noticed
that stood out to him was the wristwatch, indicating he was a level

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system message
appeared in front of Quinn's face once again. It was a constant
reminder that his health continued to decrease, not that he needed
the reminder anyway. Whenever the system message would appear, he
would have shooting pains rush through his head and stomach moments
before it. His inside felt like they were trying to tear each other
apart, and his brain felt like someone was reaching inside and
squeezing it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This feeling usually
lasted for around five minutes before Quinn was able to suppress it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, are you

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex quickly came
over to Quinn's side to give him a helping hand. He was the only one
who actually knew what Quinn was doing as he had informed him
beforehand. Vorden knew something was happening but wasn't aware of
the truth, and decided to let it be, figuring out that it was most
likely some vampire-related business. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn handed over
his money card and gave it to Vorden to complete the purchase at the
desk. The 4000 credits were exchanged, and the equipment was placed
in a fancy metallic suitcase. By the time Vorden had returned with
the item, Quinn had mostly recovered and gotten over the pain. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I hope
you start feeling better,&quot; Said Sam, &quot;I'll see you guys at
the tournament. Maybe we can meet up and watch it together?&quot; Sam
didn't have many friends at his own military base, being quite the
low level himself as a second year. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Nate
participating in the fighting tournament, Sam was pretty much on his
own. So he thought it would be nice to enjoy the event with some
others that wouldn't be quick to judge, being low levels themselves. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, that

of pain started to fade to the back of his mind. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The four of them
left the shop together and were ready to part ways as they continued
to explore. As soon as they took a few feet away from the shop, a
strange feeling was felt on each of their necks, as if their hairs
were standing on end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We're being

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know, a
group of five,&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three boys
weren't the only ones that noticed this; when Sam turned around to
check on the three boys, he could also see that a group was strangely
following them from behind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What are they
planning?' Sam couldn't help but decided to get involved. He knew if
Nate were here, he would have tried stopping whatever was about to
happen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As expected, the
group of students suddenly decided to appear and block the three's
path. The boy at the front had the sides of his hair cut short and a
purple streak running down the middle. He quickly glanced down at the
three watches before deciding to approach them. After confirming all
of their ability levels were lower than his, a smile appeared on his
face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, what do
we have here.&quot; The student said as he got closer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Um well, we're
a little short on money, you see, and we were kind of hoping to buy
something from one of these shops. I had my eye on that chest piece
for a while, and when I saw someone else buy it, it just rubbed me
the wrong way.&quot; The student then got right up into Quinn's face
as he said his next words… &quot;Especially when I see a weak level
one like you getting something like this. It would be useless in your
hands.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using the inspect
skill, Quinn was able to figure out the level of all the members of
the opposite group, even when they were hiding their watches. It made
sense why the student Zac was confident. He was a level six ability
user, and everyone else around him was around a level 4 and five. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As a group, they
seemed quite strong. After they had seen that, both Fex and Quinn
were only level ones, even with Vorden being with them, they didn't
even think they had a chance of losing. Right now, Vorden had a
random ability of a level four user he had touched, so his wristwatch
was displaying that number. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So Zac and his group
had even more confidence that the group faced no such threat in front
of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using his right
hand, Zac placed it on top of the metallic case in Quinn's and tried
to pull it away using all his strength. When he tugged though, there
was no movement, and his hand slipped off from the metal case. The
smile on his face dropped. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly, Zac grabbed
on to the case again and tried to pull it out of Quinn's hand again,
this time getting a more firm grip on the case, but when Zac tried to
pull away, a tight grip was felt around his hand which gripped the
case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the
hell…. do you think you're doing?&quot; Quinn said slowly. &quot;
This… is mine.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zac's group of
friends behind had no clue what was going on and were still smirking
away at the thought of the helpless level ones having their expensive
gear taken away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Why is this person
making me feel sick when I look him in the eye?' Zac thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When inside the
shop, Zac had carefully watched Quinn and his friends enter the shop.
Even before they had purchased the equipment, he had taken note of
their Levels. It came as a big surprise when he found out a Level one
user could purchase intermediate gear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a thought had
hit him; perhaps he was someone from a prestigious or at least a
wealthy family. They had been cursed with a son that was only able to
produce a low amount of MC cells—never being able to get past level
one. At that point, the only thing one could do was purchase beats
gear to help them on their journey through life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Having made this
prediction, Zac never thought a reaction like this would come from
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Five
against three is a bit unfair, don't you think so? Maybe we should
even up the sides a little.&quot; Sam said as he walked over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam, too, had
actually thought the same thing as Zac when he saw Quinn. The only
difference was, Sam thought he could relate to Quinn. For he was one
of those very people. A person who was unable to progress any higher
in his ability level, despite being able to purchase books at a
higher tier. His body had already hit the MC cell limit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing Sam coming
over, Zac's group of friends behind him started to get more
aggressive and were getting ready for a face-off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the tension rose
in the air, it felt like either side was going to strike first.
However, both Fex and Vorden were worried about a different matter.
For some reason, Quinn was upset at the actions that had just
occurred. It made sense anyone would be; the only difference was
Quinn had a critical secret he needed to hide. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think I know
what you mean about him not being nice now,&quot; Fex whispered over
to Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even Quinn himself
felt his actions were a little stranger than usual. Of course, he
always wanted to punish people who did things like this, but right
now was not the time, especially with as many military personnel
around as there was. Still, Quinn refused to let Zac's wrist go, and
moreover, he was starting to grip it harder and harder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zac could feel this,
and the pain was starting to get to him. He wanted to squeal or grunt
a little but was too afraid the other would laugh at him if he began
to give in to the pain and were to make strange noises. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What do I do?' He
thought, looking for a way out of this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, what is
going on here!.&quot; A deep voice said from the side. A soldier had
appeared, wearing a military uniform. &quot;There is to be no
fighting during the week stay here, do you understand? If you
disobey, we will have to lock you up for your remaining time here. If
there is a dispute, I suggest you settle it through some other
matter. I'll be keeping an eye on you.&quot; The soldier said as he
walked back off, continuing on his way to where he was going before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the soldier had
arrived, Quinn's grip had loosened and Zac managed to break free in a
split second. After hearing the words of the soldier, an idea had
popped into his head. Maybe there was a way to settle this still and
get the item he wanted. More than that, Zac felt a little humiliated
and wanted to get his pride back. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, I have a

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing Zac's words,
Quinn wanted to outright refuse whatever type of proposal was about
to be made. It was clear they were up to no good and what reason did
they have to go along with their little game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just get out

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, a person
from Quinn's right side stood in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sounds
interesting, what do you have in mind?&quot; Before Quinn could even
reject their offer, Fex had chimed in at the last second. The word
game had interested him greatly, besides they had already finished
their shopping and explored the area. Other than going back to their
hotel room to rest, there was nothing they could really do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex didn't care
about the results of the events and wasn't taking part in them, so
this might have been the only bit of fun he would be able to
experience. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Since you guys
seem more confident then your usual low levels, I thought this might
interest you.&quot; Zac and the group started to walk off, and Fex
followed without a second thought. The others looked at each other
and shrugged thier shoulders, deciding to go along. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,
they can't really do much, and you can always refuse,&quot; Sam said.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After following Zac
and his group for a while, they were eventually led to the game
section of the platform. It looked like he really did mean they would
play a game and it wasn't a metaphor for something else. The stall
they stopped at had several different booths that were open for the
outside public to see. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the booths
was what looked like an old fashioned training machine. It was a
standard upright thick pole made of metal. The pole was split up into
6 different sections, and each one had another pole sticking out of
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn watched one of
the students carefully. A digital countdown appeared above his head,
3…2..1.. When the timer reaches 0, a buzzing sound was heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The metal pole
started to twist the different sections of its body. However, not all
of the sections moved in the same direction. The very top section
twisted and the pole from the top was now coming towards the students
head from the left side. At the same time, the bottom section of the
pole had twisted in the opposite direction. Making the extended pole
attack from the right side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the same time,
the student lifted his left hand and right leg, blocking both of the
attacks. The pole twisted again and continued to twist and turn to
allow attacks to come from all different directions aiming for the
student's body. That's when Quinn also noticed, there was a small
ring where the student was standing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I see, so he has to
block all the attacks without stepping out of the ring.' Quinn
thought. 'The higher the level, the faster and more varied the
attacks.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My suggestion
is we bet that beast armour of yours by playing the game.&quot; Said
Zac.&quot; Each person here will count as a life for our team. The
first person will start at level one and keep going up until they are
eliminated, then the next person from the team will start from the
level they have left off, then whichever team finishes on a higher
level wins.&quot; Zac explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With this type of
game it was best to allow the most skilled person to go last. The
reason for this is because the person was able to watch how the one
before them failed. They could get a sense of timing for the machine
as well as witness the varied attack patterns. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're team
only has four people, so one of you can go twice.&quot; Said Zac.
&quot;The reason for choosing this game is because it requires us not
to use our abilities. I didn't want to pick something where we would
clearly be the winner. This will just be a test of reflexes and quick
thinking on your feet.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't like
it,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;I don't have a problem with the game, I
mean I think anyone of us here will be able to beat your whole team.
The problem is, what's in it for us. We gain nothing from this bet,
as the beast gear is rightfully Quinn's in the first place.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While watching Sam
speak, he was amazed at how much confidence Vorden had. He didn't
stutter when speaking in front of these higher levels, and when
pointing to his teammates, it seemed like he was genuine when he
said, he thought anyone of them would be able to beat them in the
game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought you
might say that, of course, I wouldn't just be putting up nothing on
our side.&quot; Zac, reached is not the bag of one of his fellow
teammates and pulled out a beast crystal. It was slightly clear in
colour and after Quinn used the inspect skill he was able to tell it
was an intermediate beast crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After using his
inspect skill though, another message that he hadn't seen before had
appeared. After selecting the message, the system immediately took
him to his shop showing him a single short sword. One of the swords
in his shop required this very crystal to be crafted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The weapons from
Quinn's shop were of higher quality than one could find on the market
place. The problem was, nearly all of the weapons on it required him
to gather specific items to create them. As he was still a student,
he was unable to go travelling to other beast planets to hunt for
these things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now he decided
he would just leave it for the future, after he had left the school.
Coming across one of the materials to create a weapon was a golden
opportunity for him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We'll play

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Excellent,&quot;
Zac replied, not doubting for a second they were going to lose. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Outside of the arena
on the bottom floor, Leo stood outside. He had just come from the
underground area after checking on the participating students. The
real reason why he was there though was to check on Peter. He had a
hand in helping the students during the matter with Truedream. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a chance
that using their strange and strict methods, the military would find
out he was also involved in the case. He wasn;t worried, but at the
same time he had to prepare for the worst. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Originally, there
was one, and now there are three.' Leo thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was thinking of
the strange auras that he had sensed. At first, it was only Quinn,
later Peter's aura had changed and then a third student had arrived
with the same aura. With his ability, he could tell they weren't
human, or at least not fully or not the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'The military might
be stepping on their toes in something they can't handle.' Leo had a
hunch, that if these people weren't really human, and they were
basically going to publicly execute one of their kind. Then just
maybe they would come and try save him, or at a later date, these
actions could cause a lot of trouble, possibly even another war. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The human race
couldn't handle fighting the Dalki and another Unknown entity. If it
came to it, maybe the better decision would be for him to save Peter
himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From just underneath
Leo's belt, he had a small pouch where he pulled out a small little
flask. It was the one that had been found at the last portal
expedition. He still didn't know who it belonged to, but he did know
it was a strange and powerful item. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The aura surrounding
it was similar to his own weapons. For a simple flask to be made out
of high-quality beast material would be a waste. It had to be
something special, he thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thinking that he
might have missed something, or a special use for the flask. Unscrew
the lid from the top of the flask. The contents inside the flask
remained the same, as Leo didn't want to throw it away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He swirled it around
looking at the red liquid inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he said those
words, the sounds of footsteps rushing towards him was heard. Leo
Quickly activated his ability, allowing him to cover a wider range.
After doing this, he was even more worried than before. For some
reason, the figures aura seemed to be masked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He could still see
the figure, but it seems like whatever was heading in his direction
was able to suppress it. Eventually the footsteps slowed and now he
could get a clearer view on it. Seeing it had a human-like shape, Leo
calmed down a little but was still prepared for anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The figure was now
in front of Leo, but of course, Leo could only tell someone was there
and not what they looked like. </FONT></FONT>

to the little bet, all nine of them rented out a booth and headed
over to the area. The people who walked by simply ignored what was

more difficult than it looked. One would have to be able to keep

Level 1, Start.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game had
started. The top two sections of the metal pole started twisting. At
first, the machine was incredibly slow and Zippy was able to block
two attacks. This continued on for a little while, Quinn noticed that
only two parts of the machine were moving. This was due to the
machine only being set at Level 1. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Quinn also
realized was the other part of the machine would only move once the
person placed their hand or leg down. After blocking the attack, if
one were to keep their arms up, then the machine wouldn't start until
it was able to sense that the arm had gone back down again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Forty five seconds
had now passed. All of a sudden, the machine started speeding up for
the last fifteen seconds, Zippy's expression changed as a little bit
of sweat started running down his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One minute had
passed and the sound of the buzzer had gone off, this indicated he
had passed. Zippy let out a big sigh while he wiped the sweat from
his forehead, he walked back to his teammates.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good job,
Zippy. If you couldn't even pass Level 1, then I was going to ask why
you were still hanging around us,&quot; Zac said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zippy held his head
down when he walked past the other, he had no response to give. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whoa! Go on
Pam!&quot; Fex shouted while clapping his hands.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's Sam,&quot;
Vorden corrected him, slapping his head, and slightly embarrassed as
to why he was even with such an idiot.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though the game
had started, Sam didn't look nervous at all. Instead, he was calmly
breathing and keeping it steady while blocking all of the attacks.&nbsp;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's quite
good, at least he's been taught well,&quot; Vorden commented.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought the
same. Once he concentrated and closed his eyes, he was able to focus
on his hearing. When he listened to Sam's heartbeat, he could tell it
was stable unlike the contestant from before. Even during the last
fifteen seconds, Sam stayed the same.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Sam walked back
to the others, they each gave him a high five and congratulated him
on a good job.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Pfft! Look at
them, celebrating when they only passed Level 1, they're acting like
they've already won,&quot; Zac said in an annoyed tone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was Zippy's turn
once again, this time, he was on Level 2. On this level, three of the
different sections started moving. This caused the player to also
move up and down, blocking the attacks not only to their head, but
also the ones headed towards their body. Zippy was doing well so far
with only fifteen more seconds to go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like last time,
it sped up&nbsp; in the last quarter. Zippy blocked the first two
hits and lifted his hand up to block an attack to the left of his
face, and then another to his right.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was when the
others started noticing something wrong. Although the machine's
strikes weren't all that powerful but if the attack wasn't properly
blocked, it would still hurt. It was quite similar to someone giving
a soft-padded punch, especially since the bars themselves were
covered. Yet, for some reason, Zippy's hands were shaking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the third bar
swung towards the right side of his rib, Zippy hesitated since he
thought back to the words Zac just said. His concentration broke and
it ruined his form, his movements became as erratic as he was
nervous. This slip-in was more than enough, he was just a
split-second late in blocking the blow heading towards his ribs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he walked back to
his team, he hung his head in shame. He didn't even bother making eye
contact with Zac. Zac too didn't say anything to him. It was a stupid
mistake someone at their level should never make. In his mind, Zippy
wanted to blame Zac for placing too much pressure on him, however, he
knew that his words would be pointless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now, it was time for
Sam to go again. Just like previously, he dealt with the multiple
bars coming towards him with ease. When the game started speeding up
towards the end, his breathing was a little quicker, but it didn't
batter, his pace was incredible and it looked like he was playing
some sort of rhythm game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Beep! Level 2,
Completed.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead of heading
back to the others, Sam remained in the game room. This was because
of their agreement beforehand, after another member from the opposing
side was eliminated , the other one would stay and go onto the next
level. Like this, the other team would have a slight advantage, this
was how the game worked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For example, Zippy
lost for being hit in the ribs. By seeing this, Sam would be able to
observe and dodge the same strike. Not that it would have helped much
at this stage anyways. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The machine started
once again, and there seemed to be a big jump in difficulty from
Level 2 to Level 3. All six of the sections were moving this time.
Having just completed the last round, Sam was a little tired,
however, he still managed to persevere by blocking each of the bars. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the last
fifteen seconds came, the machine's speed looked like it almost
doubled.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Left block,
right block, knee raise, right block again, elbow down.&quot; Sam
thought about every move, but this was his downfall. Before, since he
had enough time to think about everything he was doing, it worked out
for him. Now that the attacks were too fast. He forgot to breathe as
he was too focused on thinking and blocking. And suddenly, he needed
to gasp for air. When taking in a deep breath, a bar came swinging
out and whacked him on the face.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam looked
disappointed in himself. He thought he would have been able to help
out the others more. And yet, he was only able to eliminate a single
player from the other team. He realized that playing this time of
game on your own and as a team was a little different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When you were on
your own, you could start the same level again while remembering the
speed and attack patterns. You could easily get better and adjust to
the game's leve. It wasn't that Sam couldn't pass Level 3, but he
would have needed to play it a couple more times before being able to
do so. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the team mode,
they only had one chance. Each player only had a single life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry,.&quot;
Sam said as he walked back to the others.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about it, I learned quite a bit from watching you,&quot; Quinn said,
not taking his eyes off the machine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam felt like it was
all over after realizing the difference in playing as a team and as a
single player. He never imagined that they could win anymore.
Instead, he started praying to the Karma Gods, hoping that their
opponents would get what they deserve and somehow lose the match. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another student from
Zac's team walked forward and started the game. While Sam was busy
playing the game, this student had been practising off at the side
while trying to match the machine's speed. Now that he had a good
idea what the attacks would be like, everything seemed to work out
for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the minute had
passed, the game was over and they completed Level 3.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, who's

face.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While clenching his

forward. </FONT></FONT>

into the game area, a hand appeared on his shoulder and pulled him
back. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For Sam, Zac, and
the other teams standing by the sidelines, it came as a surprise for
them as to who was volunteering. The two people going at it this time
were both Level 1s. If this was an ordinary team, then Zac wouldn't
have thought too much of it. After all, it made sense to allow the
weaker one to go first. However… Level 1s couldn't just be
considered 'weak'. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were beyond
that. From the beginning, the only two people that the group focused
on were Vorden and Sam. They even thought that the other two would
have forfeited after knocking them out. Playing against Level 1's was
just a waste of time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But still, it looked
like Fex willingly stepped back, allowing Quinn to take the stage.
Vorden, on the other hand, didn't bat an eyelid at the Level 1 making
his way into the arena. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam felt that maybe
they were just letting everyone have a go at the thing, or perhaps
allow Vorden more chances to see how the machine worked. Although
their chances of winning were slim but from the looks on their faces,
they hadn't given up yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, Zac was
taken aback at the sudden situation. The very same student who
emanated a huge amount of confidence before was still displaying that
exact same amount of confidence right now. For some reason, he felt
that it was natural that he tried his best in avoiding eye contact
with Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a moment, he
gave in to his urges and looked up. When his eyes met with Quinn's,
he instinctively knew that this was a bad idea. A tingling sensation
could be felt at the back of his brain, it was almost as if it was
trying to burst out of his skull and run away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn entered the
game zone and took a relaxed stance while in the circle. The others
felt like it was all a show. They simply couldn't believe why he was
extremely calm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He'll be out

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, yeah? Do

another replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He should be

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zac didn't respond
to them. Truthfully, he didn't want to tell the others his answer,
something was telling him that Quinn would be able to clear the
entire thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game began and

himself. They were all hoping to cash in their winnings. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the timer went
past the ten-second mark, a moan could be heard since one of them

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game entered the
final fifteen second, now that all of their bets failed, they decided
to look at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as they
observed him, they found things to be quite odd. It still looked as
if he was just casually standing in the same spot. The bars came
swinging out at him, and just as one of them was about to him at the
very last second, he would be able to block the attack with his arm,
he would retract his limb and then repeat the same thing at the rest
of the bars. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Watching Quinn do
this was painful for Sam's heart. It was as if someone was walking on
a tightrope. Every single attack seemed to have been barely blocked
at the last second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam watched at the
very beginning of the round. Even when the machine moved at a slower
pace, the attacks still looked as if they were just about to hit
Quinn. Because of how things were going, he expected that Quinn would
lose in the final fifteen seconds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Beep!&quot;
The sound of the game ending and the level being completed was heard.
Sam's prediction was completely wrong. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whoa! Will you
look at that? He actually did it! Well, good news, there's no way
he's getting past the next one. Right, Zac?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, Zac
didn't respond. What the others failed to realise was that Quinn
wasn't even out of breath, in fact, he didn't have a single sweat on
him. Although the game was only a minute long, but with the unusual
amount of intense concentration and fast movements, it was still
similar to someone doing a sprint. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next participant
from Zac's group entered, it was time for Level 4 to begin. All six
compartments started moving at a faster pace than the previous Level.
Not only that, but the machine also seemed to be doing more double

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though the
student was doing well, everyone could tell he was barely hanging in
there. When the machine entered the final quarter, the first strike
struck his foot, knocking him out of the game. There were now three
contenders left, including Zac on the other team. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just the same as
before, Quinn entered the game and started off in a similar way he
left things. It even seemed like he never left the game. Quinn
continued blocking each strike just before it would hit him, he would
lift his limbs to block and simply place them straight back down. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had been an hour
since the last message had appeared, the shooting pains in his body
could be felt. Instinctively, Quinn grabbed his head and leaned
forward. This resulted in the bar striking him both on the head and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After feeling like
he suffered an unjust loss, he wanted to finish what he started.
Since Zac and his group decided to target him and had even gone as
far as trying to snatch his newly bought equipment. If anyone was
going to show them their place, it was going to be Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they saw who
was walking up to the stage, they all started to laugh. Everyone else

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'I forgot about that

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time, when the
game started, Quinn chose to take on a fighting stance. It was the
first time he had done so since he started playing the game. Before,
he merely treated this game as a type of practice, trying to see how
much he could block things before the very last second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that he had no
second chances and the will to win rose from his heart. He chose to
properly block everything. Even before the machine was able to move,
Quinn could already hear the sound of each section activating. With
the slightest movement from the contraption, Quinn placed his hand
out. To the others, it almost looked like he was attacking the
machine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the bars on
each section had the chance to fully move, Quinn had already hit
them. The machine would slightly nudge in certain sections, but it
never had the chance to perform a full strike. If he was to hit one
section of the machine before it even moved, then the game would have
been declared as a loss for the player. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was done like
this so people would stop using this type of tactic. However, the
game over sound never appeared. Instead, the beeping sound that
indicated a completed stage resounded out. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who the hell

wished Nate was here to witness what he had just seen. Not even Nate
would have been able to display something so great. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After what they had
just witnessed the whole group was silenced. Even Fex who was the
closest there in terms of skill and speed felt like he would struggle
at doing what Quinn had just done. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'That's confirmed
it, he was to be evolving to the next level, but how has he been able
to grow so fast, and right in front of my eyes.' Fex thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was strange
because Fex knew that Quinn wasn't at the vampire noble class, they
just had a certain feeling about them. He himself was very close to
breaking through to the next stage. However, Quinn was a little
strange, some of his skills, such as speed and strength were already
at the vampire Noble level but he could tell he hadn't evolved yet.
Just how was this possible? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was all because
of Quinn's unique situation, of having the system while being a
vampire. Due to him being able to grow stronger by consuming
different types of blood. It allowed his stats to go beyond that of a
regular vampire. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others were
inclined to agree, this game was meant to be about blocking attacks
and it looked like Quinn was attacking the machine himself. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One of the students
who was already knocked out from the game on Zac's side had gone to
the game admin, who worked at the front, to see if the machine was
broken. Zac knew it wasn't the case but anything to stop this bet was
a good thing in his eyes. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another person from
Zac's team had started the game anyway, if it was broken they could
always just stop and move to a different booth. But as soon as the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students had
expected the machine to be broken, the only way to complete the game
like that, was to hit the target as soon as he saw it moving to count
it as a block. Due to him thinking this, he was slightly unprepared
and after just ten seconds the student was hit and out of the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn walked up to
the game once again and started. Zac was looking at him closely and
so was Sam hoping to see another amazing display of skills. This
time, there was no such thing and Quinn just blocked the upcoming
attacks from the machine normally. There was a little bit of
disappointment from both sides as the game had ended normally. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was frustrated
after what had occurred last time, and to calm himself down he wanted
to perform at his peak, after calming down a little there was no
need, so he decided to play the game like normal. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others soon
realized once again how impressive this was. The game was set at
level five, yet when Quinn was blocking the attacks, he made them
feel like they were watching the game at level one, he blocked them
all so easily. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that Quinn had
passed Level 5 on the machine, the two remaining students had to pass
it as well, otherwise, they would lose the game. Zac's last teammate
walked into the gaming area and had begun. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before their team
was full of confidence, always being the one in the lead, but now

out of the game. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only one left
now was Zac. He clenched his fist and walked up to the gaming area.
This was another reason why he had chosen this game. Simply because
he had played it multiple times before, and felt like he was better
than the average person. When playing on level five previously, there
was always a fifty-fifty chance that he would pass it on his first
go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game had begun,
and Zac was fully concentrating on the targets coming towards him. He
blocked the attacks with commitment, meeting them before they would
fully reach their destination slightly. This meant he was getting
hurt by the bars slightly but he didn't care about that right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not hesitating as he

him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The cheering soon
stopped, and the smile on Zac's face started to disappear as they saw
Quinn confidently walk to the stage once again. They all no longer
saw Quinn as the weak level one, but instead as a monster at the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zac wasn't a
religious man, but he started to pray to an unknown force hoping that
something would happen. He knew he only had a ten percent chance of
passing level six himself. If they were both to fail, then the game
would be declared a draw and they could both walk out of this
pretending nothing ever happened. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whack, whack, whack.
The sound of the machine hitting against Quinn's body was constantly
being heard as he continued to block each shot. While doing so, Quinn
was starting to have a bit of fun, imagining multiple enemies trying
to attack him. The game was good to practice one's reflexes but was
useless for learning any skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There weren't many
opponents whose attack patterns would be as simple as this, and it
also didn't allow for one to practice attacking using their own
skills. Still, Quinn was having a lot of fun and finally was starting
to have a bit of sweat on him, as the timer had reached forty-five
seconds the smile on his face grew bigger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Zac
already had his answer, Quinn was going to finish level six, and
perhaps could even go beyond. If he wanted to do something he needed
to do it now. Keeping his hand down by his side next to his waist, he
opened up his palm and faced it towards the machine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to do a
type of pulling motion and suddenly the top section of the machine
looked almost still. Inside the machine, the mechanism was being
widened up as it was held back by a strange force. Zac had the power
of magnetism and was holding back a part of the machine. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then using all his
strength, he released as well as pushing forward causing the top
section to swing out at a great speed. What he didn't expect was the
force to be too much, the added power of being held back, with a push
of full force it had reached level 6 speed already, it caused the top
part to fling off. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Rather than being
shocked about nearly being hit by a flying metal object. Sam was far
more concerned about the skill he had just witnessed in front of him.
The move that he and Nate referred to as the flash step. This was
because whenever they saw the move being used, it really did seem
like the user would suddenly flash into a different spot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>More importantly, it
was a move that Sam had only seen one person ever perform, the person
known as Bloodevolver from the game. However, just because they had
only seen one person perform it., didn't mean only one person knew
how to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A teacher most
likely needed to teach the person the move, and they most likely
taught others. It was possible for one to come up with a skill
themselves, but knowing the information about the Bloodevolver they
did know, that seemed unlikely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They knew two things
about the Bloodevolver. One was that he was from a military school
since they had met on the military gaming servers. The second was
that the person was a first-year student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if Nate was
convinced that this, Larry Steel person was the Bloodevolver, the
only evidence he was going on, was the fact that he had met these
conditions as well as used gauntlets as weapons. Still, Sam didn't
have much more evidence himself that the person in front of him was
the real Bloodevolver, the only way to find that out was to see the
person using their ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The strange red
aura, a powerful unique ability that had been used to defeat many
opponents in the game, including himself. That's why Sam wasn't
adamant that Quinn was the Bloodevolver. On his wristwatch, it
clearly displayed that he was a level 1 user. There was no way such
an ability would be deemed so weak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, another
thought had come to him; the red aura ability was something that
shouldn't have been in the game. It was an ability that was unable to
be selected in the servers. Yet, it could still be used for some
reason, and the game devs even confirmed it wasn't a hack. Although
many didn't believe this, thinking the game devs were just trying to
save face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Maybe, this ability
was slightly different from how people knew and measured current
abilities. If that was the case, then the watches the military used
wouldn't be able to register anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam looked at Quinn
once more, he wished he could confirm it right now but he couldn't. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the VR game,
players created avatars to be used. So from looks alone, there was no
way for Sam to tell that this was the same person, and the same could
be said for Quinn. So the two were unable to recognize each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sam stood there
dazed, thinking about these thoughts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, are you
alright, man?&quot; Fex asked. &quot;I know that thing nearly hit
you, but you didn't get hurt, right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Snapping out of his
thoughts, Sam replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah I'm fine,
I was just shocked as you said, that's all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A little bit before
the incident had occurred, one of Zac's team members had gone to the
Admin room to have a look at Quinn's last match. To see if there was
an error in the game. When he had arrived, he asked the Admin to
check, they pulled up the previous match on video, and both the Admin
and the student observed the whole one-minute video. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, the game
was broken right; it didn't count any of the strikes made to the
machine?&quot; The student asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, the Admin
just sat there and remained silent. The student thought he might have
been doing some extra checks in the game, but instead, he was looking
at it, amazed. In all of his years working, he had watched countless
students play the game, but it was the first time he had seen someone
do something like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's amazing.&quot;
The man said. &quot;The game wasn't broken at all; he managed to hit
every section; the second they started to move.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The question wasn't
whether this was possible or not. There were plenty of people who
would be fast enough to do something like this. The real problem the
man was struggling with was how? If one was to know the exact pattern
of attacks and had it memorized, they could do something like this.
But the game was random and didn't always perform the same set of
actions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Somehow, the student
was able to tell what was about to move before it actually moved. The
man played the video again, and while doing so, a loud crash was
heard outside of the room. It was the sound of Quinn kicking the top
of the compartment of the machine into the wall. The two of them left
immediately to have a look at what was going on outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game wasn't
quite over yet. At least not in the mind of Quinn and his group.
Because Quinn, Vorden, and Fex weren't exactly stupid, they knew
something must have happened. The whole machine was acting strangely
and only when it was Quinn's turn and in its final moments, something
happened to the machine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using his inspect
skill on Zac once again, he confirmed that he had a magnetic skill.
He must have tampered with the game. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, it looks
like the machine broke, good thing no one got hurt, huh? Why don't we
just call this one a draw? You keep your armour there and I'll keep
my crystal. It was a fun little game wasn't it.&quot; When saying
these words, Zac's heart was beating faster, and when looking at
those in front of him, it started beating even more quickly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only was Quinn
giving him strange stares, but the other two boys next to him were as
well. The look in thier eyes was no less frighting then Quinn's.
&quot;What's wrong with these guys?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden wanted to say
something and prepared himself a speech while the others were
playing, but when he saw Quinn stepping forward, he realised there
was no need for him to say anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;First, you try
to take my armour from me forcefully, let me guess it's because you
saw we were low levels, right?&quot; Quinn said, lifting and
revealing the number on his wristwatch. &quot;Then you try to pretend
to make things fair by playing a game that none of us have ever
played before, and when you see where about to win, you tamper and
cheat at the game?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Cheat?&quot;
Zac replied nervously, taking a step back. The others with Zac knew
that the person in front of them was impressive when it came to hand
to hand combat, but found it strange why Zac was so scared. After
all, he was only a level 1 ability user. If the two of them were to
get into a fight, Zac should be able to wipe the floor with him, they
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing Zac take
another step back angered Quinn even more, he didn't know if it was
the game or the fact that he had been starving himself for the last
two days and a half, but he was getting extremely agitated by the
whole thing, more so then he would have done. He was ready to snap. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stand still!&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some reason,
