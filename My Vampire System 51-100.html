<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sun was starting
to set outside so it was just the right time for Vorden and Quinn to
head back to the academy and when they did, they immediately when
over to the VR room. Just like the capsule in the shop, it was a room
filled with rows and rows containing capsules and off to the side was
a small shop and counter where students were able to buy snacks and
refreshments. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room was
currently packed with students, just as Vorden and Leo had said, the
game was incredibly popular. Looking at the excitement in the
student's eyes and faces, Quinn started to feel upset. It felt like
there was a world he never got to experience growing up just because
he was poor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them went
up to the front counter that was stationed next to the small cafe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hi, we would
like to rent out two capsules please?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A single
capsule will cost you 10 credits per hour.&quot; The female replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing that number
made Quinn gulp. For some reason, he had expected the capsules to be
free but of course, they would have to pay to rent them. With Quinn's
ten credits he received a day at most he could play the game for was
an hour a day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't need the
money for anything else, after all, the school provided the
accommodation and three meals a day for them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, are
you ready?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah don't
worry about it, come on let's go.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The woman behind the
counter had handed Vorden two tags numbered 23 and 24. The two of
them walked around the room until they had found two capsules next to
each other, they both had large numbers displayed on the front of the
capsule in big bold ink. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Here we are,&quot;
Vorden said, &quot;With these capsules there only able to link to the
military servers. You can fight with others from other schools but
you won't be able to connect it to the normal servers, you will need
to buy your own capsule for that. When you log into the game you can
play as a guest for now and just search for the ID VBCopy and join my
room when you can.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the two
of them slowly climbed into the VR capsule. When the machine sensed
they were both comfortably inside, the capsule lid slowly started
close in on the both of them. Then before they realised it, their
minds were completely transported to another space. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was now in a
large empty white room. There were no walls in sight and it looked
like the room was endless. Suddenly a screen appeared in front of
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Welcome to
Power fighter, would you like to?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;Log in&gt;
&lt;Register&gt; &lt;Play as guest&gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden had
suggested for now Quinn decided to play as a guest. Then he went on
through the system and started to search for Vorden's gamer ID. Once
he had selected to join the person's room, he patiently waited for
Vorden to accept. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Room invite
accepted, transporting in 3…2…1…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then in an instant,
Quinn had been transported to another empty white space room, only
this time Vorden was there as well but Vorden didn't look like
himself. He looked like a completely different person. Both his hands
had been wrapped in bandages and on his face, he wore a scarf. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked like an
ancient ninja. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;err Vorden is
that you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh sorry,&quot;
Vorden said and the next second he looked like the ordinary Vorden at
school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was
that?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That, the game
allows you to customize your character so you can make it look like
whatever you want. The clothes I was wearing a type of skin, although
they cost credits so I wouldn't worry about that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of the
game was just getting even better for Quinn. Allowing the users to
create a character to be used in the game meant that no one would
know it was him, unless they knew his user name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you want to
watch me a play a few games so you know how the game works?&quot;
Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then created
a party, where Quinn was able to spectate. Suddenly in the white
space, four stands appeared forming an arena like shape and Quinn was
teleported to the seating area in one of the stands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game tried its
best even for spectators to make it feel like the real thing. Once
Quinn was comfortably seated, Vorden went to search for a match.
Vorden selected the power level of two. This way he would only be
matched up with level twos. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>there was also a
quick match option, where it would match you with anyone who had
selected the same option regardless of power level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ability he
currently had his character set to was earth. He chose this because
Vorden himself had been trying to learn the Earth ability better so
that way when Peter got stronger with it, Vorden would be able to
help him use it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When an opponent was
found he too was teleported into space where Vorden stood. The two of
them started out on the opposite side of the room, then Quinn could
see a big countdown appear over the arena. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the countdown
reached zero the match immediately began. Vorden was going up against
another Earth user. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Earth users were the
most common ability to be found. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The match didn't
last long though, as it was clear that Vorden had the greater
experience when it came to fighting. The match had only lasted a
total of five minutes but while watching the game Quinn started to
figure out how it worked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Above each player's
head was a health bar. But there was no way to show how much health
each player had. Judging by what Vorden had said this was most likely
because everyone had a different set of health depending on what the
VR headset was able to read from the body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn himself knew
this because of his inspect skill. Every time he would look at the
stats of a different person some of them had different amount and
that included him. The next thing he noticed was the fact that there
wasn't actually any damage done to the player. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden would
strike or stab a person the system would cause the player to react to
these, by startling the player but it wouldn't permanently damage the
person like it would have done in real life. Similar to a game it
would treat hits on vital parts as a critical hit but the player
could continue to fight like normal as long as their HP didn't hit 0.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After that Quinn
continued to watch Vorden play a few more games and before they knew
it their time was up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn
didn't have the time to play today, he couldn't wait to try out the
machine tomorrow. </FONT></FONT>

tomorrow. After finally remembering all the steps and believing he
had a confident grasp on the skill. He shut his eyes and went to
sleep. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day Quinn
had woken up earlier than the other two. He immediately wanted to go
to the game to create his character and test out the skill he had
been learning all night. Just in case the others wondered were Quinn
was he left a note before leaving. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he finally
arrived, the VR room was emptier than it was yesterday, most likely
because it was early in the morning and not a lot of students had
woken up yet. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went on
to do the same as Vorden had done yesterday, he went up to the pretty
lady who stood behind the counter and asked to rent a capsule, only
this time for two hours. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ever since he had
his first taste of blood, food was starting to taste bland. He still
got hungry like everyone else but the taste of ice cream and sweets
just didn't have the same rush effect it once had. To get that

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn made sure
to only consume blood when he needed to or to get himself stronger.
He was afraid that he might become addicted to the feeling and if he
did it would only cause more problems for him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before entering his
capsule, Quinn looked around the room and noticed some students
carrying their beast weapons with them. Not all student used one like
Vorden. But after watching the games Vorden had played yesterday, he
did see a few of his opponents have one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Which meant most

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just on the side of
the capsule, there was a large rectangular box and underneath were
the words written, beasts weapons. So it looked like Quinn was right
after all. After taking off his gauntlets and placing it into the box
the capsule started to scan the weapons. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After going through
all the options, he finally decided on a red spiky-haired character

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finding out
that his blood swiped worked in the game, Quinn immediately opened up
his system to check his stats again. Only unlike the outside world
where his HP would have gone down by 1 – HP. Everything had still
remained the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Was it because using
it didn't actually use any blood? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn would use
blood swipe outside the Red claw-like shape would leave his hand and
at the same time, he felt like a piece of energy inside him had left
with it. The minus in his HP would indicate that it took part of his
life force or his blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But inside the game
world, the attack did no such thing. It was just replicating what his
mind told it to do, while scanning the body inside the capsule to see
if it was possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To test this, Quinn
swiped his hand's non stop, swipe after swipe. Red lines left his
fingertips in a flurry but at the same time, no HP was lost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just in case, Quinn
opened up the game system and checked, and right next to his name
where there was a section to fill in your ability, there were the
words written none in the box. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, another
thought came to Quinn's mind. If he didn't lose any HP when using the
skill, this also meant that his skill Blood bank would have no effect
in the game. When he would get attacked it would do no physical harm
to his real body on the outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wasn't actually
losing health, so inside the game, he wouldn't be able to rely on his
blood bank to save him out of tough situations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the fact that
Quinn was able to use these abilities in the game made him think. Was
his system really an ability? At first, he assumed so, after all, he
had received the power from what had looked like an ability book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, he had
never heard of an ability before like this, but there were many
abilities in the world that Originals had hidden and kept for
themselves. Then he thought back to his status change. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next to race, it
stated he was no longer human. Perhaps his abilities were more a side
effect of changing race. Rather than an ability its self. That's why
the skills that he unlocked through the system, didn't really follow
a pattern. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What the blood bank
could do, differed greatly do what his Blood swipe did. If Quinn's
theory was right, did this mean he could also learn an ability? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He hadn't tried so
far because he thought it simply wouldn't have worked but now if he
was to test this, he needed to think long and hard about what ability
to learn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before going into
his first game, Quinn wanted to test out the hammer strike. He had
been watching the video all last night and felt like he was ready. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Place your
foot forward like this and at the same time rotate your body. The
energy should flow through your toes upwards, then as you pull back
your hand, stomp on the ground and at the same time release the
energy through your fist.&quot; Quinn mumbled as he went through the
steps. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first Quinn did
all of the required steps slowly, making sure he did all of the steps
perfectly not using any of his energy or strength. He did everything
step by step as the video had explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After going through
it a few times he was ready. In one motion he did all the steps as
fast as he could and just like the video had stated he could feel the
energy rising from the bottom of his feet, into his fist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The powerful strike
left his hand and a loud *Bang* was heard. A small shockwave in the
air was created. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the
shockwave was nowhere near the size of the man in the video, Quinn
was still happy with the result. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no longer
any need for him to delay anymore and he went and clicked on the
search function. For his first match, Quinn wanted to go against the
same power level user as him, a level 1. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Technically Quinn
himself knew he was beyond Level 1, If he was to take a guess, he
would say he was around the same power level as a 2.5 but for his
first match, he just wanted to make sure of a few things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game had found
him an opponent and he was immediately teleported to an arena. When

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn got in close
to the student and was ready for whatever was to come. That's when
the student had shapeshifted his hands into a claw-like shape and
scratched at Quinn's body. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The attack was slow

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He dashed forward
and when he was close enough he threw out a blood swipe. The student
lifted his claws to block but the second the blood swipe made impact,

to. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After defeating the
student inside the game Quinn received 25 exp points compared to his
regular 50. This was a large surprise to him as Quinn didn't expect a
fight in the game to contribute to points in his system but at the
same time, this was great news. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Due to the
heightened security around the school, it would be harder for him to
find opponents and draw out their blood. That and the gauntlets he
was using a dead giveaway. Although gauntlets were a rare weapon,
there were millions of military personals playing the game. Even if
he was to use them, they wouldn't be able to pinpoint it to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now that Quinn
was able to level up, it solved his current problem of getting
stronger without the need of consuming blood. Although he didn't know
why he had only received 25 exp. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he had to take
guess it could have been because he was wasn't fighting these people
in real life or the fact that the opponent he went up against was too
weak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without wasting any
more time, Quinn immediately went to search for another game. He set
the power level to level one that way he would be matched up against
easy opponents. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An opponent was
almost found instantly and Quinn got straight to work. Rather than
reserving his power like in the last game, Quinn decided this time he
would just send out a barrage of Blood swipes at his opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And his plan worked,
his first opponent was dealt with so quickly that Quinn didn't even
have time to find out what ability he had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's next three
opponents were dealt with just as easy as the other two. There was an
earth elemental user who was too slow to cast his spells. He simply
avoided the attacks and then when was in range, would unleash the
blood swipes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two after that
were just as easy as Quinn's previous fights, he would quickly dodge
their attacks and when he was close enough to them he would spam his
skill. Of course, Quinn knew he wouldn't be able to do this type of
thing outside the game. After all the skill had a major setback of
reducing his health. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn was ever in
the danger zone and then got attacked, he would be dead in an
instant. But he just wanted to level up as soon as possible and after
defeating the next three, he did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;Congratulations
you are now Level 4 &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time
since Quinn had levelled up, he hadn't received a new ability. He
somewhat had expected this but at the same time was hoping for
something useful. He would just have to keep levelling up and wait
for more skills in the future. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally though, what
Quinn had wanted had arrived. The reason why he wanted to level up so
fast was because of the free stat point received after every level
up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He immediately put
the point into his agility stat and now he could finally learn the
flash step from the tutorial. This time while following the tutorial
from the blonde man, Quinn was able to follow him step by step along
with the video. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike when learning
the Hammer strike, where he had to watch it repeatedly and was unable
to do everything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After several
minutes of Quinn practising the flash step he finally had a stroke of
success. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, what Quinn
did notice was while he was in the white room on his own, his body
would never feel tired. He was able to perform the flash step as many
times as he wanted without feeling tired. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This did not apply
to when he was in a match though. Using the Blood swipe did take up
Quinn's stamina, he felt this affecting him after sending out attack
after attack during a match. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It meant the white
room acted like some type of training room, where they were
unaffected by their physical bodies restraints. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the flash step
learnt, Quinn finally wanted to experience a fight with a tougher
opponent. Instead of searching by power level Quinn decided to
select, Quick match and would let fate decide the level of his
opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the real world,
you wouldn't be able to choose who you went up against so it was
important for Quinn to have experience fighting in all sorts of
situations. Then a few moments later, a match was found. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time when Quinn
entered the arena floor, he could see his opponent standing opposite
him, He was wearing a long red cape and by his side were two daggers.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn also realised
they weren't alone either, there was also a person sitting in the
stands watching Quinn and his opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh don't worry
about him,&quot; The caped man said, &quot;He's just my senior, his
watching me fight so he can give tips.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then tried
using his inspect skill on his opponent to see what power level or
ability they had but there was no luck. The inspect skill didn't seem
to work in the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But before the match
began, Quinn made sure to open up his status screen and decided to
leave it open and off to the side. During this match, he wanted to
keep a close eye on it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When both of them
were ready the countdown started over their heads </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the sound
dinged indicating the start of the match. The caped man took out his
daggers and swung them out fast. Two wind blades followed, the attack
was similar to Quinn's Blood swipe only the distance the attack could
be used was far greater and faster. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then decided
to attack with his own Blood swipe, the two lines of power clashed in
the middle and cancelled each other out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A red colour,
what ability is that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The caped man was
wondering, and at the same time, the caped mans senior was thinking
the same thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time Quinn
charged forward, his abilities all required him to be used at close
range, the caped man seeing this threw more wind strikes out but
Quinn just replied back with his own Blood swipes but this time
sending out four of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the first two
cancelled out the Wind strikes, the next two carried on moving
forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when the
caped man, lifted his cape and spun around, the blood strikes smacked
into the cape but there was no effect and not even a scratch left on
the cape. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is that beast
armour, and a high level one at that.&quot; Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them were
now in punching distance of one another, The capped man swung his
daggers out fast, Quinn lifted his hands and managed to grab on to
the daggers allowing the blade to just come out from his fingertips. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then suddenly, the
aura around the daggers grew and the wind forming around dagger
allowed the ends of the blade to grow and act more like a sword,
piercing Quinn in both shoulders. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The capped man
pulled back and went for another strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know
what your ability is but it's over.&quot; The capped man said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then suddenly,
his dagger had hit nothing but empty air and space and no one could
be seen. As he turned around a sharp claw penetrated the man's
stomach. Then another, attack, after attack at great speed was
tearing his stomach apart and to finish him off two more Blood
swipes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man watching in
the arena stood up on his feet as he saw his friend lose the match.
The two of them so far had been on a winning streak. Taking it in
turns facing opponent after opponent, the sudden loss had come as a
shock to them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That skill at
the end, what was that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then just as Quinn
was about to log out and go find another match, he heard someone call
out to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
The man in the seats shouted, &quot;Please fight me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student who had
been sitting up in the stands and watching the fight between Quinn
and his friend was known as Nate Snell. He was a second-year from
another academy and in his academy, he was well known for being one
of the strongest second years. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate often played in
the game to improve his fighting skills as this was important for him
due to the fact it went hand in hand with his ability. He was
obsessed with learning all different types of martial art skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was one area
in the game that it didn't allow you to improve on though. Even
though the game allowed you to use abilities, it did not have the
system in place to use soul weapons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This would be an
almost impossible task considering every person's soul weapon was
different, even if they had the same ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With a keen eye for
martial arts, the second Nate had seen Quinn perform his flash step,
he needed to know who this person was. The footwork in the skill was
so beautiful, so quick, that even he wasn't able to keep track of
where Quinn had gone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After asking Quinn
for a battle he was overjoyed that he accepted. For the two of them
to start their match they needed to add each other to their friend's
list first. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Hardsteely has
sent you a friend request &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn accepted the
friend request and was happy to fight, honestly, Quinn wasn't too
bothered who he went up against but after fighting against Nate's
friend, he felt like he should have a good match coming up that would
help him improve. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Blood evolver
has accepted your friend request &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Blood evolver?
Does his ability have something to do with blood, that would explain
those red lines coming out from his hands but was their such an
ability in the system?&quot; Nate thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were thousands
of different abilities in the system, so Nate wasn't sure of all of
them but he had fought many battles in the game and this was the
first time seeing someone with this type of ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the match was
about to begin, Nate had asked if he could speak to his friend Sam
for a few moments. Quinn agreed as he wanted to check a few things
out himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During the match
when Quinn used his flash step, he was hoping his own system would
show him something but nothing happened. Of course, this was because
he was in the game, but he knew that the flash step felt like it had
taken a significant amount of stamina from him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His current stamina
points where at a 12, if he was to make a rough guess, he would say
that four strikes of blood swipe took down one stamina point. Meaning
he would be able to perform around 48 blood swipes before running out
of stamina. However, if he did this, he would reach 0 HP before even
using up all his stamina. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as the blonde
man had said in the video, flash step took a considerable amount of
stamina, at most Quinn knew he would currently only be able to
produce it twice in one game. Meaning it took at least five points of
stamina. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn would have to
think carefully when using this information in a match, at first he
thought it wasn't so important increasing his stamina, as long as he
was strong enough or fast enough he could win his fights, but in a
prolonged battle and matches against multiple enemies, as soon as his
stamina dropped to 0 he would be as good as dead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only that but
Quinn dreaded the thought of having to fight in the sunlight with
these stats. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Over at the other
end of the arena, Nate was busy talking to Sam about his match. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You are such a
fool,&quot; Nate said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know, I'm
sorry,&quot; Sam replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate looked at the
flapping cape that Sam was wearing and started to shake his head. &quot;We
just got this incredible thing and you didn't even use it properly in
the fight. When he went out from your view if you hadn't turned
around your back it would have been protected. Or you could have
turtled up with the cape.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's hard to
get used to having something on your back, if someone vanishes in
front of you and you know they're behind you, you naturally turn
around. Wouldn't you?&quot; Sam replied. Sam then started to look at
the ground as he was saddened remembering how he had lost the match.
&quot;My win streak.&quot; Sam Cried. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate proceeded to
pat Sam on the shoulder with pity before walking to his fighting
spot. &quot;You know the deal, if I win against him then that means I
win our bet. And you'll owe me those credits.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Sam headed back
to the arena stands, he was praying for Quinn to kick his friend's
ass. He had lost too many bets recently and was running low on
credits. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;3…2…1…&quot;
And the match had begun. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Surprisingly, both
of them at the same time had decided to charge in. Although Quinn
didn't know his opponent's abilities, his attacks were more effective
closer in range. If he was going up against an elemental user, then
it was always better for him to get closer anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And as soon as Quinn
was within five meters, he threw out two blood swipes. Suddenly,
Nat's speed dropped dramatically, his skin started to turn into a
shiny material and his footsteps were heavy. As the blood swipes
reached and hit his body, the sound of metal clanging against each
other was heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For the first time
when Quinn's attack had hit an opponent's body, it had done 0 damage
whatsoever. The metal shine from Nate's body seemed to shift and now
was concentrated in his arm. It allowed Nate to move a lot faster and
close the distance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He pushed his hand
forward and out came a long metal silver pole. It was too fast for
Quinn to react to and the pole dug into his stomach and continued to
push him back. The attack was strong and Quinn had lost about ten
percent of his health. The pole continued to grow and push him back
and his health continued to fall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then grabbed
onto the pole with both hands and using all his strength, managed to
stop it's momentum. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wow, looks
like you're strong as well?&quot; Nate said surprised, not only did
his opponent have a ranged attack but seemed to have super strength
now as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn pushed the
pole to the side and swung out his claws, this time firing four blood
swipes. The pole then started to retract quicker than the blood
swipes and absorbed back into Nate's body. He then put both of his
hands together and the metal liquid started to form a large oval
shape and eventually formed a shield. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each strike hit the
shield and there was no effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn had
expected this result, when Nate retracted the metal back into his
body, Quinn was in front of him ready to strike, But Nate remained
calm and shifted the metal over his body to the exact spot where
Quinn was aiming for his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The punch landed but
Nate's head didn't even move a single inch and again the game had
recorded no such damage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate then grabbed
Quinn's fist and with his other hand formed the pole, whacking him to
the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, you
should be better than this?&quot; Nate said, the truth was Nate was
purposely shifting the metal into a pole rather than a sword, this
way the match would last longer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had been a while
since Quinn felt like this, weak. There was only one thing left for
him to try. Quinn lifted himself off the ground and started to
breathe in, calming himself down. Anger would only distract him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then he was ready
and Nate could see it too. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on!&quot;
Nate said as he shifted the metal pole back into his body and into
one of his fists. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn once again
charged forward and threw out a blood swipe, Nate blocked the attack
easily lifting his arm and knocking it away but it was only meant to
serve as a distraction in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn got close
enough, Nate threw out his fist and at the same time, he responded
with Flash step. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Avoiding the strike
and appearing behind Nate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Too
predictable,&quot; Nate had prepared for this after watching the last
match and made sure his back was already fully covered in the metal
like alloy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then lifted
his foot off the ground, let the energy go through from his toes up
into his fist, as he stomped down with one foot, he pulled back one
hand and let out another fist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound of too
solid objects hitting each other sounded loudly in the distance. For
a brief second the two of them was frozen in place and for the first
time, Quinn was able to do damage and it was a lot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate's eyes grew in
shock as he saw the attack bring his health down by nearly half. Nate
knew he was in danger and he could no longer take the fight as easy
as he did before. He swung his body and at the same time had shifted
a piece of metal into a sword. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But once again,
Quinn had used the flash step to avoid the strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it,
again, how is he so fast!&quot; As Nate turned to look at where his
opponent was, he was surprised to see Quinn collapsed on the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was breathing
in heavy, he could no longer move, the use of using flash step twice
including the fact that he had used hammer strike, he had pushed his
body way beyond its limits. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's do this

ending the game. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His attacks
including his blood swipe, were not strong enough to do any damage to
Nate while he using his metal ability. However, his Hammer strike
skill was. Hammer strike didn't increase his strength but now Quinn
had a good idea what it did do. It was an attack that focused on the
inside, an internal attack, the perfect counter to those with
abilities who hardened or transformed their bodies. </FONT></FONT>

enough level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second lesson
the fight had taught him was how important stamina was. The flash
step was an incredible skill that allowed him to avoid a strike in an
instant but if he used it more than twice, then he would be done for,
and if he was out in the sun, he wasn't even sure he would be able to
use the skill at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This made Quinn
think long and hard about what to put his stat points into in the
future. Perhaps going for an agility or strength-based character
wasn't the best thing after all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that in mind,
Quinn had set up an important meeting with Layla today. There was one
thing he needed to learn about more than anything, especially if he
wanted to get stronger in the future. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a Sunday so
Quinn still had the rest of the day off, before having to go back to
the standard military lessons for the week. The sun was out bright
and early and Quinn was standing outside the school gates patiently
waiting for Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though it was
the weekend, Quinn still wore his school uniform for he didn't have
any other clothes, other than what was provided to him and he had
long grown out of his old school uniform. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This damn
sun!&quot; Quinn said while his body was covered in sweat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; All current
stats have been halved &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ever since he had
evolved from a human into a Halfling, the sun seemed to bother him
even more. He was covered in sweat even though it wasn't that hot and
he was starting to have ringing headaches if he stayed outside too
long. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, after
waiting a while, Layla had arrived, she was wearing a beautiful red
dress that showed off her long legs nicely along with her short hair.
She still carried her bow and had her quiver by her side and on her
back was a fairly large bag. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You ready?&quot;
Layla asked smiling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
large bag on her back, it must have been heavy he thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you want me
to carry that for you?&quot; Quinn asked, although with his stats
halved and his strength draining from his body, he was hoping she
would say no. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay the
bag is lighter than you think. I'm using my ability to make it
lighter.&quot; Layla replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn really wasn't
sure if she was being truthful or not and didn't really know what to
do in these types of situations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Were you meant to
insist and be pushy? Or be a gentleman like and offer a hand, or
listen to the girl, If she said she could do it, then she could do
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Quinn
didn't want to think too hard about it and decided to just let Layla
carry on holding the heavy bag. If she wanted him to really carry the
bag then she should just ask him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
walked out of the school's premise and carried on walking until they
eventually reached a nice quiet park. There were some students
outside messing around playing with their abilities and at the same
time there was some military personal relaxing on the benches. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peaceful isn't
it?&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah it's kind
of nice,&quot; Then a thought came into his head, of all the news he
had heard on TV, about what life was like during the war, how it
could start up again any second and finally the death of his parents.
&quot;But who knows how long it will last, that's why I need to keep
getting stronger.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla placed the
heavy bag on the ground and it seemed like it was a weight off her
shoulders. Even if she was using her ability it would be tiring for
someone to keep it up on the whole walk here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when Layla
started to empty out all the contents in her bag. There were all
sorts of things inside, there were several items of thick clothing,
such as hats, scarfs, sunglasses and most of it seemed to be black in
colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then she continued
to pull out even more stuff, lotions and lotions of sun cream and
finally she pulled out an umbrella. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did it cost a
lot?&quot; Quinn asked, worried after seeing how much she had bought.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
about it, my family sent me the credits and I used up what the
academy gave me.&quot; Layla replied, &quot;Besides I got it all from
the market place so it was dirt cheap.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The marketplace was
an online store that was used all around the world. It sold your
everyday items such as food, clothes, utilities and other things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the use of
teleporters, your items were able to be shipped to you in almost an
instant. As long as you could afford one of these, if not you would
have to go to a collection point. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And the military
school had one of these collection points for students to use. But
other than just your everyday items, the market place was also used
by people to sell and buy beast weapons, Skill books, Ability books
and all sorts of things that would be beneficial to you in battles. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, to access
this part of the market place you would either need military personal
ID, which all students got a temporary one to use during their time
there or if you were a traveller. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Travellers were
people who didn't work for the military but worked for a private
company and often went into portals to explore different worlds. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them had
gathered in the park, not just for a casual chat and peaceful evening
but there was a goal in mind. And although Quinn usually found Layla
obsessive, it seemed like her crazy strange self would come in handy.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The whole purpose of
today was to find out if there was any way to either, reduce the
effect that the sun had on the system, or even temporarily stop it
altogether and there was no one better than Layla for the job. She
knew everything about vampires having grown up reading about them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She ordered whatever
she thought might have been effective. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at all
the items that she had brought over, he then noticed that noticed a
few more things on the ground with her. There was a metal shaped
cross, a clove of garlic and even a piece of silver jewellery. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh those are
for later,&quot; Layla said embarrassed noticing Quinn staring at her
stuff. &quot;We should also try to find out if you have any other
weaknesses of normal vampires as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, why
don't we just try the umbrella first,&quot; Quinn said as he knelt
down to pick it up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then stood still
and popped open the umbrella, it was solid black in colour to make
sure that most of the light didn't penetrate or get through it. Quinn
then adjusted the umbrella a few times to make sure his body was
completely covered in the shadow, then to his surprise. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Stats have

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was
fully covered under the shade, his stats had returned, then he lifted
his hand and placed it outside the shade zone ever so slightly and as
soon as the tiniest part of his finger was outside the same usual
status screen had appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It works, but
even if a little bit of my body is in the sun then I start to feel
weak.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This wouldn't do.
Holding the umbrella although would return his stats, it would be
difficult to use in a fight. One hand would be occupied holding the
umbrella while the other would be free. Also, it was a big weak
target that the enemy could easily destroy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But at least he
found out that if he just carried an umbrella with him, he would no
longer feel weak. It was a good idea to keep one on him for now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's a
special umbrella.&quot; Layla said, &quot;It's one used to block out
the UV from the sun, although at most it can block out about ninety
percent it's not perfect. To be honest, I'm surprised it worked.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is the UV rays
why I feel weak then?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not
necessarily, I mean Vampire lore is all over the place but these
myths had to grounded somewhere right?&quot; Layla then looked at the
ground and picked up the sun cream. &quot;If the umbrella really
worked because of the UV then the sun cream should have some effect.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then walked up
to Quinn squirting some of the cream onto her hand. &quot;You ready?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went a
little red thinking about Layla applying the cream onto his body.
Looking at Layla now out of her school uniform, he realised she was
kind of cute. So what she was a little strange and knew too much
about Vampires. Everyone had there geeky thing they knew about and
was obsessed with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn felt
something cold on his leg. She had taken Quinn's silence as a yes and
started to slather the cream all over his body. After making sure
everywhere she could see covered in cream, to finish it off she
placed sunglasses over Quinn's eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Although we
can stop the UV on your eyelids, we can't on your eyeballs.&quot;
Layla said, &quot;Well anything?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time, there was
no such result, when opening up his status the UV cream hadn't even
made a little bit of impact. Quinn still felt incredibly weak and his
stats were still halved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So it looks
like it's not to do with the UV then, although the umbrella worked it
can only block so much of the UV and same with the cream, so I was
hoping it would have some effect but this means its most likely some
other property in the sun that we don't know about.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To be honest, Quinn
was thankful that the sun cream didn't work. The idea of waking up
every day and doing it as a daily routine, at some point the cream
would ware off too. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He also couldn't
imagine in the middle of the fight asking his opponent to wait to
lather and cream himself all over. He had pictures in his head of
asking Vorden to cover for him, while he brought out a bottle of sun
cream. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, it was time
for the last test, this one Quinn was dreading the most, the clothes
test. He was already sweating and feeling hot as it was and couldn't
imagine putting on a load of black clothing. But he thought it was
best to get it over and done with as soon as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First Quinn placed a
sweater over the top of his body, then a pair of black thick
trousers, on his feet, instead of trainers he changed to black boots
than on his hand a pair of leather black gloves. Finally, on his
head, he had a large back top hat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at him,
Layla could barely hold in her laughter he looked absolutely

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Breathe,

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, we might
as well try the rest.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then continued
to place clothes onto Quinn, this time she had covered his face with
a balaclava, and even where his eyes were, she had put a sleeping
mask on. More hats were placed on and now every inch of his skin was
covered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No!&quot;
Quinn shouted, but it sounded muffled through the clothes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Layla
didn't give up yet, she felt like if the umbrella had worked then
this had to work as well. She continued to place all the remaining
clothes she had brought with and then finally while Layla was piling
on the clothes, Quinn managed to shout something. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait it's
working!&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the clothes
had worked, Quinn was around three inches thick in black clothing.
Layla quickly helped Quinn take of all the clothing as it seemed like
he was a bit wobbly on his legs and was going to pass out any second
now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the two of them
were finished, Quinn opened up the umbrella and the energy started to
restore back into his body again. The two of them sat down on the
clean-cut grass and were discussing the results of the test. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, you
can't go out like that.&quot; Layla said, &quot;You couldn't move in
the thing,&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Agreed but at
least we know that the most important thing is to stop the sun
hitting me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
feel the umbrella wondering if perhaps he could get clothes made out
of the same material. Then the problem would be the material would be
too weak. Most likely the reason the clothes didn't work so well was
because they didn't block out the sun enough. He needed more solid
but flexible material. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was some stuff
out there that might have worked, like a black latex suit or
something but these weren't strong enough for fighting, it could
easily be torn or ripped and then he would be back to being normal
weak Quinn again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly a thought
had entered Quinn's mind. He started to remember the fight he had
inside The VR game. When he had gone against Sam, he had used a cape
that was able to block his blood swipe. The material was not only
flexible but strong as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The cape was most
likely made from some type of beast, from one of the portals, if
Quinn could get enough of this material, maybe he could make a suit
of some kind that could not only protect him from the sun but also be
strong enough to be used in combat. </FONT></FONT>

some beasts. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finishing the
test with the items, Layla was eager to try out a few of the other
things she had brought along with her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do I really
have to worry about something like this?&quot; Quinn said as he
picked up a clove of garlic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not really, to
be honest, I just wanted to try out everything, garlic always acted
more as a repellent in the first place and the fact that you're
holding it like that, would suggest it wouldn't hurt.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn looked
at the piece of garlic, he decided to use the inspect skill on just
to be sure. If something would harm him, he was sure the system would
be able to tell him basic information such as this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; A glove of
garlic. Due to your heightened senses, the piece may test extremely
bad. Safe to consume &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The good news was
the system had informed him that the garlic wasn't poisonous, which
meant it would be able to do with the other items as well. The bad
news was, that he had to still eat the garlic so Layla didn't get
suspicious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He broke the glove
into a small piece before placing it into his mouth. The taste was
incredibly strong, it felt like he was eating dog crap. Not that he
knew how that tasted anyway but if he had to imagine this was it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quin immediately
started to spit on the ground trying to get the taste out of his
mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, at least
you look fine,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had actually
expected this result before even using his inspect skill. The taste
of food had slightly changed ever since his evolution. Sweet food
such as ice cream and cakes now tasted bland, it was the same with
fruit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing that
still tasted fine for him was meat. Although everything seemed to
taste slightly saltier than before, it was the same with other herbs
as well. Although there was one thing that drastically changed for
him and that was blood, it was a greater taste than anything he had
before and was sweet as caramel itself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just thinking about
it, Quinn wanted another taste, but he was still able to control
himself just fine. It was the same way when someone thought about
chocolate, they suddenly wanted chocolate but they didn't need it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before touching any
of the other items, Quinn made sure to use his inspect skill on each
one. First was the metal cross. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A religious
symbol that has no effect.&quot; The system said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A sliver Chain
that is made up of 92 percent silver. Wearing the item can be used as
a fashion accuracy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With both the items
there was no such warning. Quinn then proceeded to pick up both of
them with no worry. He was starting to trust the system more and more
lately as it had been more helpful and accurate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what's the
story behind these two things?&quot; Quinn asked. &quot;I kind of get
the cross but what about the silver, and they just for werewolves?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly Layla's
eyes started to sparkle up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm glad you
asked, Vampire lore has gone further back then you think even in
Greek mythology they have tales of a vampires. The first Vampire was
said to be cursed by the god Apollo, to be burnt by sunlight, then
when the man tried to touch Artemis bow, she cursed the human further
to be effected by silver.&quot; Layla explained, &quot;Of course
there are other reasons but this is one of the older ones. Then with
the cross, Vampires have always been seen as workers of the Devil, a
creature that needed to suck blood to live and of course God in the
eyes of many, is a fighter of evil and the cross is a symbol of the
god.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then Grabbed
both items form Quinn and placed it back in her bag. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But now
looking at you, I can clearly see all of that was a load of rubbish,&quot;
Layla said sounding a bit disappointed by the whole experience. &quot;The
only Vampire weakness it seems you have so far is sunlight, although
I have to admit that's a pretty big one, do you feel like you're not
getting older yet?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What?&quot;
Quinn said confused, &quot;How would I even know, it's only been a
few days. I mean I don't feel any older but I could say that about
the rest of my life, you kind of just got older without realising
it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a dreaded
thought had entered Quinn's mind, if it was true that he would no
longer age, did that mean his appearance would stay the same as it
did now? Would he look like a young teenage boy for the rest of his
life? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With test over, it
was time for the two of them to head back to their dorm rooms. Quinn
decided to head back to the dorm rooms and see if Vorden and Peter
wanted to hang out and do something for the rest of the evening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when he entered
the room, once again neither Vorden or Peter was there. Vorden, Quinn
didn't worry too much about, it seemed like he had been getting into
trouble lately with the second years, but currently they were staying
well clear of him after the incident. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was Peter, Quinn
was more worried about. He couldn't help but shake the feeling that
these new friends of Peter weren't actually friends of his and was
wondering what to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that Quinn
decided to sleep for the night and wait till the next day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he woke up, he
was happy to see that the other two had managed to return to their
rooms in the middle of the night. For once the three of them had
decided to head down to the canteen together and in a long time, the
three of them casually eat food and chatted about what they had done
yesterday. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the three of
them had finished eating, it was time for them to head to their
homeroom classes together. On Monday morning they were to attend a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before Del was to
inform the students about the Portal training they would be
participating in. He needed to explain to the students how the
portals worked. After all, it would be a first for nearly every
student there apart from a few of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Portals allowed
humans to travel to and back form locations that they had been to
before. They were often used to travel to other planets. The
technology was obtained when humanity managed to take down there
first Dalki ship and discovered a portal inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, when such
advanced technology was discovered, people wouldn't be able to
dissect and replicate it so easily. Just because you had the
technology didn't mean you understood how it worked. But thanks to a
legendary scientist named Richard Eno, he had easily been able to
dissect all of the equipment found on board of the ship. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another great
contributor to the war against the Dalki. Some people assumed that he
had an ability of some sort that helped him along the way but these
were just rumours and no one knew for sure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, one thing
for certain was he was a great man. Once he had found this
technology, he distributed it not only to the military but also to
private companies as well. He made sure that such power wouldn't just
end up in one group's hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back then the world
and humans were fighting together but who knew what would happen once
the war had ended. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In today's world,
there were generally three different groups of people who had and
owned portals. The military was the first group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next were private
corporations. They usually had powerful originals backing them, many
of these companies would also form a faction, a group of powerful
Travellers just for exploring other planets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And lastly was the
group known as Pure, a group that didn't believe in the use of
abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were three
types of portals each different in colour, there was green, orange
and red. Each of these portals meant a different thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Green meant that the
planet it led to had already been explored and there were human
shelters that had been built. These allowed people to live there if
they wished or just stay their temporarily. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next was Orange,
this meant that the planet hadn't been fully explored yet, there were
some Shelters in place but the level of the beast could be too high
in certain areas or they just hadn't explored everywhere yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And finally, the Red
portals, these were unexplored planets. There were no shelters for
regular humans to live in. Only travellers or military personal would
usually go into these portals for exploration and the worst thing
about them was they didn't know if the Dalki were on the planet as
well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After all, the Dalki
had the same technology so it wouldn't be too strange to run into
them and although under a treaty, if a few people were to go missing
on an unknown planet, it was hard to prove something had happened and
the humans weren't ready for another war just yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And that is
all the information you need to know about portals,&quot; Del said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A student then
raised his hand who seated in the centre of the class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about the
beasts that were discovered on those planets, will we learn about
them.&quot; The student asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For now,
that's all you need to know about the portals, yes this also led us
to discover beasts on these planets and they are what we use to
create our beast weapons but you will be told more detail bout that
when you arrive.&quot; Del explained, &quot;Although I will tell you
now that you can also thank Richard Eno for that discovery as well.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del then closed the
presentation that was playing behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now for the
important part, the portal expedition will take place next week but
before even that, you will be required to form your own team of five.
Although on this trip you will travel as a class, you must have a
squad and stick together. Even the green portals are a dangerous
place filled with beasts and the trackers on your watch will not work
outside the academy, we will have no way to come and save you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The same student
once again raised his hand and Del had a look on his face like it was
starting to get annoying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
where we will be going?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That
information will be reviled to you on the day, many of you here have
family members who if they knew where you were, would send guards out
to protect you on these planets but that wouldn't be fair, especially
since we will also be assessing you on this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student once
again raised his hand but Del this time stared at him back forcing
him to slowly put his hand down again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now if there
aren't any more questions, you're combat classes for today are
cancelled, today you are to form a team of five and report back to us
by the end of the day.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del then left the
room to attend to other business while allowing the students to form
their own group of fives. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then turned
his head immediately. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But standing by
Quinn's side already was Layla, who had sprinted from the front of
the class to the back. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
want to make a team with me Quinn?&quot; Layla said smiling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Err sure,&quot;
Quinn answered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Truthfully, Quinn
wanted to ask Layla to be on the same team, they didn't know how long
their first assessment was going to take and if he was to get hurt or
injured, he was going to need a blood source of some type. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even if Vorden
didn't like it, he knew this was going to happen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Quinn you
mind if I join as well.&quot; He said smiling trying to hide his
annoyance. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course, and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter's face was a

his feelings were confused. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only were Quinn
and the others shocked that Erin had approached Vorden but so was the

nearly everyone wanted her on their team but over the last few days,

started to thumb louder, a fear started to take over him as he heard
Erin speak these words. If he didn't get in Vorden's and Peter team,
he would be in huge trouble. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why do we need
you anyway?&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait a
minute,&quot; Layla interrupted, &quot;I think she would make a good
addition to the team, besides Vorden, doesn't your ability rely on
those around you to be strong as well. As far as I remember beast
doesn't have abilities so you would have to rely on us, and we don't
exactly have strong abilities.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla, I
understand what you are saying but for once I agree with Vorden,&quot;
Quinn replied. &quot;I don't care how strong she is, she can't just
come in and kick one of us out. She can join the team but only if
Peter stays.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was good to have
strong allies but at what cost. If Quinn was to kick out Peter to
replace him with a stranger, he would just be as bad as everyone else
who had treated him like crap just for being weak. He didn't want to
change into one of those types of people. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin then started to
look around the room before looking at Vorden once again. She thought
back to how Vorden was able to deal with Momo quite well before the
use of the soul weapon. After looking around the room there didn't
seem to be a single person in Del's class that matched up to him. </FONT></FONT>

to get annoyed by all her taunts, but he took a deep breath and held
it in. With her on the team, it would cause fewer troubles with the

to steal them. </FONT></FONT>

to the strength machine, all he wanted to do was punch the machine as
hard as he could. He wanted to shut up the arrogant Erin who felt
like she was better than everyone else. Why did she choose to act

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate continued to
observe Quinn and his fighting style and wondered just why he didn't
fight the same as when he fought against him. Quinn repeatedly went
into match after match and would only go up against level ones. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was clear to Nate
that he had purposely set the system up this way, now some players
would do this if they perhaps were trying out something new but from
watching Quinn, all he could see was Quinn doing the same thing over
and over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He would enter into
a game and them immediately dash in either using a barrage of the red

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unknown to Nate
though, Quinn was purposely doing this, he didn't have much time left
between now and when he was to go out on to his portal training. So
the only thing Quinn could do, was grind a few levels to get stronger
using the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, thirty
minutes had passed and Quinn himself was growing tired of repeating
the same thing over and over again. The only thing that kept him
going was seeing his experience go up little by little. That's when
Quinn noticed that he had a spectator. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate who was sat in

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a thought came
to Quinn's mind, the fact that Nate was watching gave him the chance
to ask him something. He then went onto the game system and sent out
a part invite to Nate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Nate was
just panning to spectate and watch Quinn play a few games, he wanted
to study Quinn a bit more before asking him to another duel. But when
he saw the party invite, he was quite surprised. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The game only
allowed for one on one battles so the party invite feature was only
really used between teammates for practising or if they wanted to
chat and were far away. In the end, Nate was too curious and wanted
to know what Quinn wanted and decided to accept. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The arena ground
disappeared and now Nate and Quinn wherein a single white room once
again. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, how you
doing I hope you're not planning some type of revenge are you?&quot;
Nate said as he proceeded cautiously towards Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No actually I
wanted to ask you something, the person who I fought with before,
your friend, I wanted to know more about his cape and where he had
received it from.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh Sam's cape,
that's why you wanted to talk to me&quot; Nate then looked at Quinn
standing in front of him. On his hands, he wore his gauntlets. That's
when Nate suddenly realised something, the gauntlets that Quinn were
using looked horrible. They must have been only at the basic tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait a minute,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Err yeah, I
will be going on my first portal outing, I thought if you could tell
me what type of beast you got it from, I would be able to look for
it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate was suddenly a
little surprised, he went back and thought to how Quinn was able to
damage his solid body even though no one had done such a feat before.
He was sure the person would have at least been a second year. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me give
you a piece of advice then, on your first outing they always use the
green portals, you have the chance of going to one of three places.
Caladi, Almpin and Bartnee. Out of these three planets, you want to
go to Caladi, there in the desert, there is a winged creature. I
can't remember the name of the winged creature but there aren't many
in the desert so I'm sure if you see one that will be it. That beast
core is what we made the cape out of.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait did you
say, a desert?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, what's

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, the word
desert meant the place came with heat, the idea of having to journey
through that, Quinn was starting to get tired just thinking about it.
</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nothing don't

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, sure go

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought about
it for a while, if he didn't want to let Nate watch all he had to do
was block him or delete him of his friend's list, but at the same
time, Quinn felt like there was no problem. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was just fighting
people, it wasn't like he was doing anything that suggested he was a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn only had
twenty minutes left inside the machine and using his remaining time,
Quinn chose to use the Quick match function on the game. Matching him
with random power levels who chose the same option. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This half of his
session would be used to practice his fighting skills. In the
remaining twenty minutes, Quinn was able to have two more games. His
first match he was against a level four user, who had a
transformation ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His body was made of
a rubber-like material and he was able to stretch it as far as he
liked. Quinn struggled against this opponent, the fighting style of
the rubber man was strange and when Quinn wasn't expecting it, he
would be hit at an incredible speed. In the end, Quinn managed to get
a few blood swipes in and hurt the man but still ended up losing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next match there
was much more success as he was matched up against a level two user
who had a hardening skill similar to Nate only weaker. He had an
easier time dealing with this opponent as his Blood wipe deal damage
as well as his regular attacks. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end though,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate after watching
Quinn for the whole time had a strange thought lingering on his mind,
just what was Quinn's ability? After their battle Nate had decided to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other thing was
it seemed like all Quinn could do was shoot out red lines, which

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, even
though the post had gained some traction there weren't many. After
all things like this were posted on a daily occurrence and usually,
it was from some people who couldn't accept a loss thinking the other
person must be hacking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But those who did
watch the video started to ping the creators asking If what was seen
in the video was real. Of course, one of the Admin staff for the game
came along and checked the video but this person wasn't any ordinary
admin staff, it was a student at the school named Logan Green. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan himself wasn't
ordinary for he was the son of the creator of the game and not only
that but was one of the head coders as well. He often visited the
forum to check for bugs and if there were any, he would try to fix
them while still attending school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then suddenly late
at night that day he noticed that post had started to gain traction.
Usually, he wouldn't have bothered with these things but the staff
where getting tagged in the post more than usual. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After watching the
video, suddenly his attention had been caught. Logan immediately
could tell that the video was real. He searched up the two user ID's
that were in the game and then decided to look at the match
information. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After searching them
up he noticed that the player that was being questioned in the video
had selected no ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No it couldn't
be, did he really manage to hack the system?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then began to
dig in deep into the match and checked everything about it. He
checked the log of the game and everything that had been written down
as the match went on but there wasn't a single thing he could find
that was wrong. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan actually felt
relieved, the game so far had been successful not only because of how
it was able to accurately replicate abilities but also because the
game had yet to be hacked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finding out
this information, Logan had no choice but to think it had something
to do with his ability. Although originals abilities weren't able to
be copied into the game, this was the only answer he could think of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But one question
remained and that was just who was the user behind the user behind ID
Blood evolver. It was company policy to not keep records of any of
the users in the game. The data was scrambled so not even he could
get access to it. But that wouldn't stop Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next Day combat
classes had resumed back to normal, Layla the other day had gone to
register the team with Del and even he was surprised at who was
written on the list. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group became the
talk of the class, after all, they were the only ones with such a
huge difference in power levels between the team. Something that
hadn't happened in the school before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the combat class,
the group were told to continue training independently and if they
wished to spar with a partner they could politely ask. Leo would go
around giving tips to the students when he could. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the afternoon,
after classes were done, Quinn would head the VR room to continue his
daily routine. He continued facing low-level ones and used the second
half to train. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the more people
Quinn played against the more traction the original forum post was
getting and all of this was unknown to Quinn. He didn't even know
there was an online forum for the game. Quinn had never had any of
these things in the past. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had access to the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only was Quinn
quickly gaining exp, but he also felt like he was getting a hang of
his abilities more. He knew when was the right time to use flash step
and also learnt how to combine his two skills, so he would be able to
disappear and reappear while using Hammer strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In two days, Quinn

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the second
year's office, a group of first years had been called to into the
General Duke's office. Standing at the front of the first years was
Earl. The same boy who had recently been hanging around with Peter as

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have made

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day after
combat classes had ended, Peter had messaged for Vorden and Quinn to
come to the training room on the east side. This room was usually

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah that's

and had finally arrived inside the training centre. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room was large
and there were several large metallic objects with an oval shape in
the middle. Each one of them had a glowing circle in the middle

them to another world. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Vorden

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright let us

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two of them
picked up Peter, Quinn had a strange feeling, as he looked at Peter
closer, he noticed that even though his clothes were badly torn, he
didn't look to be in such bad a shape that he shouldn't have been
able to walk. Even the bruises didn't look normal almost as if they
were drawn on. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And someone was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When teleportation
devices were first discovered there was hope that they would be able
to set these to travel to wherever they wanted to. At last, the idea
of colonizing planets such as mars was a dream come true. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Spacecraft had been
invented but were unable to travel at light speeds needed to make it
viable. However, they were able to create large portals that allowed
ships to travel through. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the dream was
short lived. The Portals were only able to pinpoint planets at a set
location, a place that was not known to their universe, perhaps a
whole different dimension together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No one knew the
truth and scientist could only theorize where exactly these portals
led to, but what they did find was each of these planets harboured
deadly beasts. Beasts that had never been seen before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when the first
beast was killed and harvested for research, the beast crystal
located inside it was discovered. Inside the crystal contained a
power far greater than anyone could imagine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although many would
say the success of defending against the Dalki was due to the
discovery of the originals. This wasn't exactly true, their abilities
only took them so far in the war. There weren't many with powerful
abilities strong enough to go against the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Their technology was
too advanced compared to humans, nuclear weapons would be portaled
out somewhere before they even hit the ships and bullets did no harm
to Dalki skin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then a new
discovery was made with the beast crystal thanks to Richard Eno once
again and that was the discovery of beast weapons. Human combining
their abilities with powerful beast weapons was the true turning
point in the war, but not many people remember this fact as they were
too fascinated with the discovery of abilities that happened nearly
at the same time. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorend jumped
into the red portal he felt a tingling sensation all over his body.
The world around him started to warp and displace and his mind felt
like it was melting. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't a horrible

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few moments later
and Vorden had arrived at his destination. He opened his eyes and the
first thing he noticed was the place was incredibly dark. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sky was black
and the only light source available was from the two moons out in the
distant sky. Around him were crumbled down buildings and structures,
as if at one point the place was used to live in. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden still had his

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It seems like

longer and he might have come out and done something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What does that
matter&quot; Raten argued, &quot;Do you even know where we are, you
jumped through that Red portal!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then started
to look at his surroundings, it was strange to see building
structures around them. Buildings were the sign of human or an
advanced civilization and so far when discovering other planets there
had been no signs of this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When there was
building work, it would usually be Dalki structure but this was

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Aren't the red
portals meant to be unsheltered planets? This place looks like a
broken shelter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think you
are forgetting something.&quot; Raten said. &quot;While orange may
mean it's in the process of being taken over and sheltered being
places, Red can also mean it's too dangerous to build a shelter in
the first place. You have basically given us a death sentence.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you really
being so stupid, sure you might have run through that portal so you
didn't kill your friend but what's the point if we die instead. The
only ability we have right now is that weak level one earth ability.
If we run into a deadly beast we're doomed.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That wasn't the only
problem, the place wasn't exactly thriving with people. Not many
people had access to teleporters in the first place. Only green
teleporters the public were able to use, and they were strictly
monitored by the company that owned them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meaning the only
people that would be around here would be travellers. With no people
around and only beast, Vorden was stuck with his one ability and it
would only last him 24 hours. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a thought came
to Vorden's mind. Quinn. The portal was unable to send you to a
pinpoint location but it did put you in the same general area, at
least within ten miles of each other. Still, ten miles was a great
distance to cover and with the chance of beast being around every
corner, it would be hard to find Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, Vorden
would look for a Portal back to the academy while also searching for
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Somewhere on the
same planet, Quinn had also arrived. His heart was beating rapidly as
it was the first time he had experienced such a thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, what
the hell was that!&quot; Quinn thought, &quot;Damn it, he must have
pushed me through the portal, Where am I?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn looked
around, he could see the similar buildings around him all crumbled
torn and fallen down. The place looked like a city had once existed
but had been left behind for years. However, there was one saving
grace about the whole thing, on the planet it was currently night
time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meaning Quinn didn't
feel weak and had a better chance of surviving. However, before Quinn
had even moved from the spot he was in, he spotted something from the
corner of his eye. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was standing in
the middle of a street surrounded by crumbled buildings on both
sides. But whatever was moving around was quick and was using the
buildings as cover. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn tried to
follow whatever it was with his eyes but it would constantly move
around until it had eventually stopped just underneath a pile of
rubble from one of the buildings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;In the movies,
this is where the person would go check it out.&quot; Quinn thought,
but there was no way he was going to do that. He was on an unknown
planet and all alone and whatever it was, it was clear it didn't want
him to see it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
back away making sure to keep an eye on where he last saw the figure,
then when he was a safe enough distance away, he finally turned
around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In that instant, a
sound could be heard from behind, Quinn immediately turned around and
could see a horrible figure running towards him, it clearly wasn't an

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Quinn
could hear the sounds of something scurrying towards him at an
amazing speed. As he turned the beast was now in full sight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the same size
as a large dog with the head of a rodent. Black in colour and running
on all fours. He would have said it looked like a giant rat however
its body parts were muscular around its arms, while its body remained
incredibly thin. So much so that the outline of its ribs could be
seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the creature
was a few feet away it leapt in the air and claws appeared from the
creatures two front limbs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn almost out of
instinct swiped his hand letting out a blood swipe. The attack
managed to hit the beast and sent it flying back. The attack had
caused a large cut to appear on the creature's stomach and black
blood started to leak from the wound. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the beast was
taking the time to recover, Quinn decided to use his inspect skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike with humans,
when Quinn used the status screen it would show there HP and blood
type, but in this case, he had only received a name and the level of
the beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the tier of
the beast though, Quinn started to feel a little less frightened. He
was in an unknown place and just because the beast was small in size,
didn't mean it was a low tier. However, something like the Rattaclaw
even Quinn should be able to deal with it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Rattaclaw had
recovered and charged straight for Quinn once again, seeing how the
blood swipe was effective he waited for the beast to get close once
again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn had
underestimated the speed and the responsiveness of the Rattaclaw. It
had learnt from last time what to look out for and jumped to the side
avoiding the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then it dashed
forward increasing its speed and jumped out at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just in time, Quinn
had managed to shove his gauntlet into the mouth of the beast, as
it's two big teeth clomped down onto the gauntlet, he heard a
creaking noise. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You little

refusing to let go. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the beast stuck
to his arm, it was too dangerous for him to use blood swipe and too
close for him to perform a hammer strike. All that was left, was to
do it the old-fashioned way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then started
to repeatedly pound the beast on its head with his other hand. With
each blow, black blood would gush out of the beast. The blows were
powerful and damaging to the beast and with each strike the grip
started to loosen. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you had

continued to punch the beast, until finally, its grip had come loose
and it had fallen to the ground. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked like he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Multiple

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Levelling up had
given Quinn one extra stat point. Looking at his stats now he decided
to put the stat point into strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason for this
was the skill Hammer strike, it needed a total of 15 strength to
perform, while he had the gauntlets on they gave him an extra bonus
of three strength but when the Rattaclaw had damaged the gauntlets
the strength dropped to two. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If his gauntlets
were to be destroyed, then he would no longer be able to perform
Hammer strike correctly. So first Quinn decided he would get his
strength up to fifteen before focusing on stamina and agility. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the system still

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Blood spray:

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The skill reminded
Quinn of a shotgun he used to watch form the old movies. Where the
small pellets would spread out hitting multiple targets. The problem
was the cost of the skill. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>5 HP was a huge
amount and even with his blood bank Quinn would have to be careful
when using it. The plus side was that it was a skill designed to hit
more than one opponent. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn had Layla
around, he would like to test the Blood spray out but he didn't know
how long he would be stuck here, so it was best to reserve his HP and
as much blood as possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then walked up
to the dead beast on the ground. He had punched the creature so hard
in the skull it was indented and blood was leaking everywhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the black
blood it didn't seem appetizing at all. He wasn't drawn to it like
regular human blood and it didn't give off a sweet fragrance either. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system had been

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last thing he
needed to do was rip or cut the body open and look for the beast core

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the Rattaclaws
were fast and would soon catch up. That's when Quinn spotted a

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing on top of
the platform Quinn had a clear view of the giant Rat like creatures
coming towards him. He aimed carefully and then when they were about
halfway up the stairs, he activated his skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His arm jerked back
as the skill activated and a strong force of blood left his hands
spreading out. The five Rat's out in front were sent flying back and
toppling down the stairs. However, the shot had only hit the ones in
front and the Rat's behind quickly climbed over their fallen
comrades. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn decided to
head further up the stairs to create more distance between him and
the Rats, but then, he could see there was a huge problem in front of
him. Part of the ceiling from the floor above had crumbled and
collapsed onto the staircase blocking his way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no longer
any space for Quinn to go up. He turned around and the Rats were just
starting to ascend the second set of stairs. The Rats from before
were quick to make a recovery and were behind them as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time Quinn held
out both hands with his palm wide open. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first spray of
blood left his hands and knocked the Rat's over, then when the group
behind them started to ascend he cast blood spray again with his
other hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Rat's had fallen
over and were badly hurt by the attack, but knew they would soon
recover. There were several small holes over their body where blood
would leak from but they just weren't deep enough to cause any
serious damage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He made sure to keep
his distance away from them and stayed on top of the stairs. Although
Blood spray was good at hitting multiple targets it wasn't as strong
as blood swipe. Only the force of knocking them back was powerful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn was to get
close, he was afraid that the rats might recover and surround him, so
there was only one thing he could do. He started swinging his hands
out rapidly aiming carefully at each Rat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the red claw-like
lines left his hands, at the same time he could hear multiple
messages ding in his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Rattaclaw has
been defeated, 100 exp &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Rattaclaw has
been defeated, 100 exp &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The messages
continued onward until eventually, all of the Rat's had been killed.
Quinn then fell to the floor on his knees gasping for air. The
continues use of the Blood swipes along with his new skill Blood
spray had tired him out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Blood bank has
auto activated &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; 50 millilitres
remaining in Blood bank &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;
Congratulations, Blood swipe has reached Lv. 2 &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After sitting down
for a few minutes and recovering his stamina Quinn was finally be
able to stand, he took a moment to take in all of the messages he had
received. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only half of his
blood bank now remained. As long as he didn't get injured he only
needed to consume 10 millilitres of blood every two days. This meant
the remaining blood in his bank would last him a total of ten days.
He didn't know how long he would be on this planet but he needed to
be careful about using his skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he got into a
situation where he needed to fight, he needed to use his fists, and
only rely on his Blood skills in an emergency like in this scenario. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Who knew if there
was another human being on this planet? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were only two
good things that had come out of the whole situation, the fact that
his blood swipe skill had levelled up. There was no change in the
description on how it worked, but assuming it had now levelled up, he
hoped it was now stronger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the system was
like a game, then it meant the more he used the skill the quicker it
would level up. The only thing Quinn was unsure about was whether or
not using the blood swipe in the game had helped it level up quicker.
There was no way for him to tell as there was no experience bar for
his skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second good
thing that had come out of this, was the EXP he had gained. To gain
the same amount of experience points as he had just gained at this
moment, he would have had to play the game for days. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then walked up
to the dead beasts on the floor. Before when he had killed the first
Rattaclaw he didn't have time to extract the beast crystal from its
body but inside the building, it seemed like he was safe from other
creatures. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using the tip of his
gauntlets he tore open the beasts, he searched around inside the
chest looking for a glowing crystal. Usually, someone doing this for
the first time it would affect them. Maybe they would have even
thrown up a few times searching around inside the organs of the
beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But for some reason,
Quinn felt like he was unaffected and it didn't bother him at all. He
couldn't help but think ever since he had become a Halfling his view
on what was normal and what wasn't was changing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After searching
around for a while Quinn finally found it. It was a small round
crystal ball with tiny little bumps all over, and around the same
size as an adult's fist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Basic tier
Beast crystal obtained &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;Would you like
to store it in your inventory?&gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then another message
had appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Inventory?&quot;
Quinn thought, &quot;You mean I had one this whole time!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn selected the
yes option and suddenly, the crystal in his hand slowly started to
vanish away and finally, it had completely disappeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then opened up
his status screen and now there was a tab for inventory, as he
selected the tab he could see the single beast crystal stored inside.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wonder if I
can put anything else in there?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then tried
using his mind to store his gauntlets into the inventory, if he could
store weapons and other things it would be really handy for future
trips. He tried and tried but nothing appeared from the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whenever he wanted
to do something with the system in the past, all he had to do was
think about it and it would work, but even taking off the gauntlets
and touching them, thinking about the inventory while wearing them,
nothing seemed to work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although he was able
to make the crystal he had obtained, appear into his hand and back
into the inventory at will. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went to
extract the crystals from the remaining nine Rat's. Each time he did
he found it easier than the last to locate it inside the body and
every time he held a crystal in his hand, the system message would
appear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Basic tier
beast crystal (10) &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had collected all
ten and couldn't help but feel pleased with himself. The beast
crystals could be used to turn into beast weapons or beast armour but
looking at the rat-like creature Quinn had no idea what it could be
used for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every beast crystal
depending what beast it had come from had a different use and you
could try to figure it out from what the beast was like. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For example, if a
beast crystal was obtained from a large turtle-like creature then it
would most likely a defensive item could be crafted. Maybe it could
be turned into a shield or even a good piece of chest armour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But regardless, even
if the item created Quinn had no use for, the least he could do was
sell the basic tier beast crystals. Each crystal sold would sell for
a total of ten credits. Which meant he could either use the money to
purchase beast gear himself or he could use it to spend more time in
the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After tinkering
around in his system and his stamina fully recovered, Quinn decided
to try to climb up to the roof of the building. Even though the
building he was in was safe, he was on a strict time scale and needed
to find the portal back fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He walked around and
looked for any cracks and gaps he could see in the stairs.
Eventually, after making a few detours he had reached the top of the
building. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The building was
about three stories high and wasn't the biggest but at least he now
had a better view of where he was. As he looked around all he could
see were buildings that resembled human structures. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when he
spotted something, one of the buildings without a doubt had the same
crest as the school he attended. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So this really
is a human shelter, but then why is it all ruined and destroyed?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The building was
large in size and square-like but only two stories high, out of all
the buildings around it, it was in better shape than all the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had recognized
the building as they had one in the city, he was currently in. It was
the military storage room. It was where they kept all their high-end
equipment, ability books, skill books and beast weapons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There's a good
chance the portal might be located in there?&quot; Quinn then
startled to smile, &quot;Even if there isn't, I can't waste this
opportunity.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

years, he was a busy person. He would normally be in charge of
looking over the new students arriving and doing research into each

a more powerful background. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The original
families had a big say in what went on and what didn't. Although it
was compulsory for every person to go to military school for two

After the incident with the second years, Nathan decided to look into
Vorden's family background a bit more, and if they were to find out,
this would be bad news. &quot;Make sure his family doesn't learn
anything, we have to keep this a secret for as long as we can.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

was Peter's body shaking slightly. </FONT></FONT>

Vorden was, did they not come back to the dorm room yesterday?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

this morning?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla noticed that
Peter was sweating like crazy, it was normal for Peter to act a

will be unable to go on the outing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla, on the other
hand, was more concerned where Vorden and Quinn were. Why hadn't the
teachers said anything about them not attending class? If they were
injured in a fight last night then the guards should have picked them
up and taken them to the nurse's office. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was also a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As class ended the

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin had then come
over to where Layla was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Any idea about
the other two?&quot; Erin said bluntly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I have no

nicely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
didn't know each other well and their interactions with each other so
far had been short. It actually surprised Layla that Erin had come
over to her in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No thanks.&quot;
Erin replied, &quot;Now that the portal training has been delayed, I
am in no rush to find them, but I came over to tell you some news I
heard some students talking about.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla leaned in to
listen carefully. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yesterday,
while I was walking by two students, said they overheard the Sergeant
shouting at the general, something about two students going into the
portals. My guess is that's the reason why this whole thing has been
delayed in the first place.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then stood up
from her seat and grabbed Erin by the shoulders. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin had moved her

and felt a little uncomfortable. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't you see,
Vorden and Quinn have to be the missing students, no wonder Del
didn't say anything about them.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then suddenly, it
felt like she was being handed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle one by one
but there was still one missing piece and she knew exactly the person
who could give her the last piece. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As she turned her
head, she looked Peter dead in the eye. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter felt like
Layla was staring into his soul, this whole time he had been worried.
What if someone had seen him leave the portal room? What if the other
first-years reported it was him? He hardly had any sleep last night
and couldn't concentrate on anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when Layla had

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Knowing that there
were likely more basic beasts in the area and not wanting to attract
their attention. Vorden had run into the closest building. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was mainly a
large empty warehouse with several broken crates and scrap metal
piles all over the place. With only one entrance, he had no choice
but to fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His skills faired
him well. Even though he only had the Level a one earth ability,
Vorden was skilled. He placed his hand on the ground early on as soon
as he had step foot on the planet and had transformed a piece of
earth into a dagger. It was the weapon he was most comfortable with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He managed to dodge
the Rats attacks at the right time and slice at the beast. The only
problem was the Rat's skin was tough and Vorden's powers were weak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't have
monstrous strength and could only rely on the ability and skill given
to him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But eventually,
Vorden managed to cause enough damage to hurt the Rat significantly
and just as he was delivering the final blow, another Ratttaclaw had
come up behind him. At the last second, he managed to react but its
claws had still sliced the top of his head, causing three small marks
to appear. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, then,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then left the
seat in his mind and allowed Raten to take his place. It was a
pitch-black room with a single chair, and above the chair was a
shining white light. The light above the chair was the only source of
light in the whole room. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, Vorden
walked off into the darkness and inside was another figure that
looked just like Vorden, only he was sitting on the floor swaying
backwards and forwards. Their fingers would constantly roll around
each other and part of his shirt was in his mouth. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, is Quinn

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This time is

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden went to
walk back to the seat, he could see that Raten had already dealt with
the beast rather quickly. The Rat was covered in several earth spikes
that were piercing through its body from the ground. Its back tail
had been cut off and black blood was falling from its mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Raten then stood up
from the chair and allowed Vorden once again to sit in the glowing
light and the chair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then
proceeded to carve out the beast crystals form the two Rat's and
placed them in his trouser leg pocket. It would have been a waste
after defeating them just to throw them away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But just as Vorden
finished extracting the beast crystal, the sound of clanging was
heard from behind. Vorden quickly turned around to see what it was,
and to his surprise, it was a fully grown adult man, he had emerged
from just behind one of the crates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I come in
peace,&quot; the man said with his arms lifted up. Although the man
quickly put his hands down and started to place his hand around his
ribs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just from looking at
him, Vorden could tell straight away the man was a Traveller and a
skilful one at that. The equipment he was wearing was at least at the
advanced tier beast level, and he had armour all over his body
including two short swords on his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man then sat
down on the ground, to have a rest and lent his body up against one
of the crates. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden walked over
to traveller cautiously, it was rare to even meet a traveller in this
type of place and who knew what the man's true intentions where.
Someone had to be at least at a decent skill level to be asked to
enter a Red portal planet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry I
won't bite,&quot; the man said, &quot;What's a kid like you doing in
a place like this? I didn't know the military was that desperate that
they were now sending a single student to a hell hole like this.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that Vorden was
closer to the man he had a clear few of him. He had short purple
spikey hair and it had several marks on his face. By the way he was
holding his side, it looked like he had some broken ribs too. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like we
both have the same goal at least.&quot; The traveller said. &quot;The
names Ian, I came through another portal and was hunting out a beast
in the wild, I was badly hurt and too far away from the original
portal, so in a last-ditch effort, I decided to come to this
abandoned shelter. I was hoping to either find some medical equipment
that could heal me or maybe even a portal that led back to earth.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian then looked at
the two dead Rattaclaw's on the ground. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're quite
skilful to have defeated two of them on your own, especially for
someone as young as yourself. You have my thanks, I was too badly
hurt from the beast before, that Rattaclaw had chased me into the
warehouse and I was waiting for it to go away. I never expected
someone else to be here in this shelter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sure, there

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few hours had
passed since Vorden had first arrived on the planet and it seemed
like it was still night outside. It was troublesome for him and made
it harder for him to spot beasts. Especially in the rundown shelter
where they could easily hide between buildings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no lights

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meaning while they

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
when the sun will rise?&quot; Vorden asked, &quot;Maybe it will be
best if we travel once the sunlight comes out, then we can spot
beasts easier.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You really
don't know where we are, do you?&quot; Ian replied, &quot;This Planet
spin cycle last an entire year and right now, we are only six months
in. I'm afraid we won't be seeing light for a very long time. but if
you want to wait six months, you go ahead.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no sunlight, it
was hard for Vorden to tell how long he had actually been on the
planet and he could only guess. This was a problem for him. Right now
Vorden had the earth ability as well as Ian, the Travellers ability
but without knowing when 24 hours had passed. He wouldn't know when
an ability would disappear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After waiting a few
more moments, Ian was able to stand up again, he winced a little as
he stood up and placed his hands on his side. Vorden noticed it
before but now he was sure of it, the man was badly hurt. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're
wondering what happened aren't you.&quot; Ian said, &quot;I was out
hunting an advanced beast requested from a company. I don't know why
they wanted it so bad, but it was from a specific beast that could
only be obtained from this planet.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you get
it?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then Ian pulled
out a crystal, the same size as Vorden had gotten form the Rat, only
this one shined a lot brighter and had a clearer layer on the
outside. The core itself of the crystal could be seen better. The
clearer the crystal meant the higher tier beast it had come from. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the two of them
were ready, they decided to head back outside, while Ian took the
lead. They made sure to travel close to the buildings rather than in
the middle of the street. If anything spotted them they could quickly
dart inside for combat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Vorden, I
have an idea.&quot; Raten said, &quot;Why don't we kill the
adventurer while he's weak and get that crystal of his? We could sell
it for a fortune or even make some really good equipment out of the
thing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you an

last for twenty-four hours, if we don't find a way out of here in

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the middle of the
street laid a single dead Rattaclaw, the two of them looked around
before proceeding to move closer to it. When they arrived, they could
see that the Rattaclaw had his head completely bashed in. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
it wasn't killed too long ago and it's had its head pounded in,&quot;
Ian said as he bent down to get a closer look. Then he suddenly
pulled out a beast crystal. &quot;Whoever it was they didn't have
time to remove the beast crystal, they were probably being chased by
something else. Strange, I didn't expect to see one person here but
it looks like there's now another.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Actually,&quot;
Vorden said out loud. &quot;I wasn't the only one who came through
here by accident, my friend came here with me and I was actually
hoping to find him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I won't ask

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing from
Vorden that there was another student here. Ian felt like he should
try help out. At least confirm whether or not this friend of his was
alive. He knew that the Rattaclaw's rarely travelled solo which meant
most likely he was chased by a few more after defeating the first
one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
continued to follow the trail until it eventually led them to a
three-story building, as they entered the first floor it was mostly
empty with no signs of anything, but Ian decided to continue to
follow the trail of black blood that led up the set of stairs. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What happened
here?&quot; Ian thought. As they walked up the first set, they could
see more and more black blood splattered everywhere on the walls.
Then when they walked up even further, the two of them were stunned
at the scene. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who did this?
Are there more people here, maybe another team on a mission?&quot;
Ian said. &quot;I'm sorry, I thought perhaps the Rattaclaw outside
was killed by your student friend but it looks like I was wrong. You
would need at least a small team to take out ten at once like this.&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even Ian who was a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
decided to climb to the roof. This way Ian had a bearing of where he
was and could decide where to go next. They stood on top of the roof
and looked down, that's when the two of them spotted something. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a beast that
walked on six legs, three on each side, its body stood upright like
that of a human while the bottom half was like that of a scorpion but
then where it's head should be, there was a single large mouth, four
arms, and it had four large claws. It was a hideous beast that
clearly wasn't from earth. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey what's
that building?&quot; Vorden asked, as he noticed the building was in
good condition. &quot;Could the portal be inside there?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's the
storage room.&quot; Ian answered, &quot;I doubt the portal would be
inside there, usually those places get targeted by thieves and such
so they tend to not make the portal area so obvious and even if it
was in there, it would be best if we let the beast leave first. The
way I am now I would stand no chance against the thing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The storage building
was a single level large floor, which resembled that of a hanger. The
main purpose of the building at a shelter was to keep equipment such
as mechs, airships and all sorts. They also used it as a temporary

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had left the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If there was a
single Rat on its own then he might have chosen to confront it, but
while there were three of them out on the street, he didn't want to
risk it. The experience points gained from killing a beast was
tempting but to fight three at once, meant there was a chance he
would either have to use his blood spray or at least his blood swipe
skill. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn continued to
head towards the storage building until finally, he had arrived. At
the front, there were two large steel doors which slid open. Afraid
that they might make a lot of noise and attract unwanted attention.
He decided to walk around the building to see if there were any other
openings or entrance. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After walking around

reached the back of the building, he started to hear strange noises.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He came out from the

As he got closer to it, the Rattaclaw snarled at Quinn and tried to
swipe its claws out, but the attacks were far to slow and the beast
could hardly move. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Still trying

the beast continued to swing it's arms out towards Quinn despite it
not being able to move. Its leg's had been crushed by something and
it had a large wound on its stomach. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before entering he
gulped at the thought that perhaps whatever injured the Rat might be
inside. Crawling on his front, he had reached the hole and tried to
pop his head in. It was big enough for a human to fit through but
what he was afraid of was inside the building. If he entered the
building there might be a hundred of those things or something that
was stronger than the Rattaclaw itself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn crawled
forward to the entrance of the hole and started to look into the

completely void of light from the moon. His vision allowed him to see
clearly inside. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After scouting the
area for a while, it seemed like there was nothing inside, but of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He crawled through

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to walk
around the hanger for a while until eventually, there was a room
stationed in the corner. It was hard to tell how big it was but it
seemed like it went the whole length of the hanger and on closer
inspection, it looked more like a large container. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He walked up to the
room and there was a single steel door with a passcode device next to
it. The door was military-grade which meant even those with abilities
would find it hard to break it down. Perhaps it was the reason why no
one so far had been able to enter including the beasts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But it was clear to
him, that whatever was in the container had yet to be destroyed and
most likely whatever was inside was important stuff worth locking. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Should I try

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing that the
intermediate beast was patrolling around the storage room, Ian and
Vorden had decided to go to a different part of the shelter. As Ian
said it was most likely the Portal wasn't there in the first place. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though the
portal was in a red zone, the portal on the other end still had to be
placed in a safe place to make sure either beast from the other

could bring a portal with them to get back to their own world but
these were very expensive. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My guess is
somewhere underground. It's safe from most of the beasts that way.
Most likely they have a special building that looks like any other

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well we can
rule out all the residential buildings, they wouldn't be able to
build a large enough base under those, and any of the small buildings

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
continued to look into building after building but there was no luck

like a library. Although most of the books had been destroyed and
several of the bookcases had fallen over as well. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
went up to the second floor of the building. There were large holes
and broken-down walls on the first floor which made it easy for
beasts to attack them. Once they had reached the second floor, the
two of them started to lift up a few of the bookshelves. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like Ian
had the ability of super strength seeing how easily he moved the
heavy bookshelves, but Vorden knew that wasn't true. The reason why
Ian seemed like he had extra strength was actually from the beast
armour he was wearing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Certain beast armour
once above the basic tier had special properties. If the user was
able to activate these properties, they could increase the base
strength of the user. Giving him more power, extra speed. Overall, it
just improved you as a human being and almost made you seem to be a
superhuman. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden could see Ian
was still struggling though, most likely due to his injuries but
there was no way he himself could move the giant bookshelves so
easily. So instead Vorden helped out in his own way by clearing a
space and moving all the books and piles of rubbish away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After an hour or so

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a nice

are you waiting for, come on let's go inside.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden walked
inside Ian followed behind and as he did, he pulled one last
bookshelf around them, sealing them up in a cube-like shape
surrounded by bookshelves. The room they were in was now pitch black.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian then punched
part of the bookshelves with his fist, creating a hole in all four
directions letting in a little bit of light, but more importantly, it
was used to let them peak through and see if any danger was coming
towards them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then pulled out a
little small stone from his pocket and placed It on the ground in the
centre of the room. He tapped the stone once and a warm orange light
started to shine from it. The light wasn't very strong but in the
small dark room, it made a huge difference. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Here take
this,&quot; Ian said as he handed a small circle pill to Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is this a food

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I'm

</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden looked at the
pill before shoving it down his throat and into the stomach. A food
supplement was a pill that contained all the things a human needed to
live. As long as a person took one pill of these a day, they no
longer needed to eat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although it gave the
human enough calories and vitamins, it did nothing in terms of water
continent. You would still need to find your own water source.
Luckily in the shelter, it seemed like the waterworks in nearly every
building was working. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So it wasn't a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You get some

Ian said. &quot;Sounds good?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he heard the

be contained. </FONT></FONT>

Quinn said as he stepped into the container. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as he stepped
in, his hopes of finding legendary beast equipment or stashes of
beast crystals were soon lost. The room was simply filled with

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He once again went
on rampage grabbing every book he could on the shelf, absorbing those
that he couldn't and tossing the others on the ground. Although he
would have loved to take the books with him as they would have sold
for a healthy price. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The books so far
were unable to go into his storage like the crystals and carrying
them would just be more trouble than it was worth. After going
through all the books Quinn was able to level up a total of two more
times. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No new skills were
unlocked but Quinn still obtained the regular stat points for every
level up. Now that his strength and agility were at level fifteen, he
decided he should finally increase his stamina points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If there was a fight
that needed him to preform flash step and hammer strike multiple
times, he would definitely be in trouble. After putting the two
points into stamina his stats were now looking a lot more even. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the Exp
needed now was getting further and further away. Which made Quinn
think if there was even a cap to his levelling, or would the exp
amount increase so much so, that it was no longer possible to
achieve. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had now nearly
touched every single book that was in the storage room.
Unfortunately, the highest ability Quinn was able to find so far was
a level three ability book. The further he went into the container
the higher the levels but for the last few shelves, it didn't seem to
be the case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like they
were just duplicates of the other level three ability books. As Quinn
picked up one book the system message didn't go off. It was because
it was a level 3 earth ability book that he had already absorbed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, maybe
Peter could use this?&quot; Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was only one
book, Quinn was sure he would be able to carry it safely with him.
But as soon as he thought about Peter, a memory entered his mind and
it wasn't a good one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was the whole
reason why he was in this place, and he still didn't know how long he
was going to be here or if he would even be able to survive. To be
honest, Quinn was just trying to make the best out of a bad situation
at the moment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he thought about
Peter anger started to enter his mind and body and he ripped the book
up. He was willing to hear Peter out if he ever got out of here alive
but Quinn would no longer help him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If someone like that
betrayed you once, for whatever reason, it only meant there was the
chance that the same thing could happen again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then as Quinn looked
around the container, he noticed there was one shelf at the very back
of the room where he hadn't been yet. He didn't bother going over
there yet because it looked empty from a distance, but as he got
closer, he noticed there was a single book that had been placed on
there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he touched the
book on the shelf, a new message appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Level 6 ability

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After seeing the
first message appear Quinn couldn't wait to see how much experience
points a level 6 ability book would give. Perhaps it would finally
shoot him up to level ten and he would unlock the use of the shop in
his system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then something
unexpected had happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Ability is

to learn? &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of shock Quinn
dropped the book back onto the shelf and took a step back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out of all the books
in the room, it was the first time he had ever received a message of
this kind. He wasn't even sure it was possible but the system was
clearly telling him he could learn the ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn started
to think back to the name of the ability &quot;Shadow element.&quot;
It was something he had never even heard of before and Quinn was
quite knowledgeable about the abilities of the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then picked up
the book once more just to make sure and the same message had
appeared. After thinking about it for a long time, he decided he
would try to place the book in his storage. It hadn't worked with the
other books previously but he thought it might work with this one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And to his surprise,
it worked. The ability book was safely put into his system storage
with his beast crystals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before learning the
ability, Quinn wanted to make sure he could find out more about it
first. Maybe then he could find out why it was compatible with his
vampire system and if so, maybe they were other abilities that would
be compatible as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If that was the
case, Quinn didn't want to rush into things. Usually, a human being
was only able to use one ability for their whole lives and it could
be the same for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he continued to
level up and get stronger, he thought about it more and more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His system wasn't an
ability, the book that was gifted to him by his father wasn't an
ability book but it had completely changed him. He was no longer
Human but something else altogether and it was why his abilities had
worked inside the game and why he had received the option to learn
another ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the only
conclusion he could come to. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After storing the
book away, he decided to close the door to the container unit and
remain inside. It was safe here and he was starting to feel tired, at
least he knew the container was strong enough to protect him from
whatever beast remained outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He layed down on the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn had

dealing with an intermediate beast would almost be impossible for
him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The weakest of
intermediate beasts were at least 10 times stronger than a basic tier

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But looking at the
creature, Quinn could tell it would be a tough battle. Instead, he
decided to remain inside the capsule until the beast had eventually

the chance it could leave. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After waiting for
what felt like a considerable amount of time, He decided to open the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was when Quinn
noticed something else that was in the hanger that wasn't there

placed in a pile of scrap metal. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he saw the eggs a
horrible thought had entered his mind. Quinn hadn't noticed them
before meaning she must have just laid them out while he was in the
container, or they might have been hidden somewhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the first was
more likely, now the fact that her eggs were here, meant the beast
would protect them until they hatched or at least it wouldn't be
moving for a while. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had two
options, he could continue to wait in the container hoping that the
mother would have to go out and hunt for food for herself in a while,
but beast bodies were completely different compared to humans. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Sometimes a single
meal could last them weeks before they had to go hunting again for
another one. This felt like a risky option for Quinn for he himself
was on a time frame. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then there was the
second option, if the Scordana had just given birth then there was a
chance she was weaker compared to usual. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the second
option, he had to make a decision as soon as possible. The longer he
waited the more chance the beast had of recovering. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Quinn
gritted his teeth and stepped out of the container. Before even
thinking of fighting against the beast he would try his best to sneak
out. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The entrance to the
front of the hanger was completely destroyed, the beast when entering
had ripped apart the two metallic doors before coming in. The problem
was the beast was blocking that exit but that still left Quinn with
the small hole in the wall from where he had entered. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that the
Scordana had spotted Quinn, he had no choice but to stand his ground
and fight. In a red portal planet, there would be more dangerous and
higher tier beasts than an intermediate one. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although he could
make a run for it and head outside, the commotion caused might
attract even more dangerous beasts and that was the last thing he
wanted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
squashed Rattaclaw, he could tell the beast was powerful and he
needed to avoid getting hit by those claws. Already using the flash
step had taken a considerable amount of stamina and at most, he was
able to perform it one more time during the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the scorpion
creature turned, it immediately started charging forward. Hoping to
scare it away and do some damage, Quinn let out two Blood swipes.
This time the attack was more powerful than before. The lines looked
thicker and larger as they left his hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The level two
increase in the skill, on top of his extra stat points in strength,
had really improved the attack. However, the Scorpion wasn't stupid
and covered itself with its four claws blocking the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the Blood swipe
made impact, the scorpion was pushed back a few steps but no damage
could be seen, not even a white scratch mark on the claws. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it, the
scorpion's claws are an exoskeleton!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An exoskeleton beast
meant that the beast's skeleton was on the outside, making the outer
shell incredibly hard. As Quinn looked and inspected the creature
even closer, he could see that every part of the beast was covered in
some type of shell, apart from the upper body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was the beast's
weak point and that's where he needed to hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With a plan set in
his head, Quinn charged forward once again, the scorpion opened up
its four claws ready to attack. The first claw came down, swiftly he
was able to dodge the attack, then the next set of claws followed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Avoiding the claws
was difficult but right now Quinn was in full concentration mode, as
the fourth claw came out to attack him, the beast's body was now wide
open. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then as Quinn
readied his hand to cast his blood swipe skill, he felt a sharp pain
in his back. As he looked up, he could see something connected to his
body and when he followed it, it went behind the beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A tail, that

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast then
lifted Quinn with the tail and chucked him hard up against the wall.
As he fell to the ground his HP had taken a huge hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn looked into
his stomach, he could see a large puncture had been created and blood
was quickly flowing out of his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the blood
continued to leak out of Quinn's body so did his HP. In order to stop
his HP from continuing to drop he had no choice. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he absorbed the
blood, the puncture in his stomach slowly started to heal but it
wasn't going to be enough, he needed more blood and with the Scordana
charging towards him he needed it fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his health
nearly full, his wounds had healed up almost instantly and Quinn was
able to move once again. Looking at the scorpion he noticed the tail
truly wasn't there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it wasn't for all
the level's up he had received while in the container, he would have
already been a dead man and with no more Blood bank, Quinn was unable
to take another blow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were no more
second chances. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hoping to stop it's
charge forward, he threw blood swipe after blood swipe. The beast
held up all four of its claws and crossed it against its body,
protecting it at all times. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the beast was
powerful and continued to push through despite the blood claw's
coming towards it. It got closer and closer but Quinn never stopped
using his blood swipes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A battle of strength
was being displayed between the two. The red swipes were powerful and
started to knock the beast back and eventually, even the claw's
started to crack but neither of them gave up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn couldn't
keep it up, if he carried on using the blood swipes then he soon
would completely run out of HP, he had no choice but to change his
plan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the beast was
close enough, finally the tail was revealed from above. While its
claws covered and blocked its body from the swipes, its plan was to
attack from above with its long large tail. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As it fired its tail
downward, just before the tail could pierce Quinn again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Quinn was
no longer in front of the scorpion and now was directly behind it. He
gathered all his strength from the bottom of his body. It rose up
into his fist and as he slammed down his foot, at the same time he
pulled back his hand and released all the power he had into his
attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the blow
had hit the beast's soft human upper body, a large hole was created,
it was around the size of a human head and a chunk had been taken out
allowing him to see completely through the beast to the other side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a few moments
later, the beast had collapsed to the ground and so had Quinn,
completely exhausted. As he lifted his hands his gauntlets had
completely shattered. They were too damaged from the Rattaclaw's bite
from before and it was unable to take the impact of his Hammer
strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The gauntlets no
longer gave Quinn the extra attack power it did before but it was
hard for him to be upset for long for a number of messages had
appeared. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a thought had
come to his mind, if his system was like a game, if he levelled up
would his health heal back up? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he looked around
the room, he noticed the three egg's still there in the metal pile

walked up to the dead Scrodana's body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had no hard
feelings tearing the beast's body apart as he looked for the beast
crystal inside. Before the old Quinn might have shown compassion and
been respectful but the fight he just had, was showing him that even
on other planets, the strong ruled. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before, even when he
got bullied at school it was never like this, of course, the strong

Portal</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Due to Quinn's
energy and most of his blood being used in the fight earlier, his
body was now no longer naturally healing itself. He was too hungry to
heal and would need blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn looked at
his system, a certain number stuck out to him and it was all he could
hear in his head, the number Thirteen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;With thirteen
points that's thirteen hours before I reach 0 and that's only if I
don't use any of my skills or get injured along the way.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was really
struggling with what to do, should he sit and wait, perhaps the
school would send someone after him, or should he walk around and try
to find the portal. If he did, there was the chance he could run into
more beasts on the way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have no
choice, I have to try to find the portal,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was his only
option. In reality, he would have liked to think the school would
have sent someone after him. This might have been the case if Quinn
had a strong family backing him or he was a potentially high-level
user but Quinn was none of those. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was an orphan
with no family backing and the school still believed he was a level 1
user, someone with no ability. Why would they bother risking their
lives for someone like him? It just didn't make any sense even to
him. He had no choice but to soldier on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving the
hanger, Quinn had to think hard about just where the portal would be.
All he knew was that they had to place it somewhere safe. Somewhere
the beasts wouldn't be able to get to it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shelter was a
big place though with many buildings, it wasn't as big as the city
the school was in, but still big. To get from one side of the shelter
to the other it would take him at least two hours and that was
walking at a decent pace. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he walked through
the city, he decided to tread very carefully. Even if he came across
a basic tier beast, it would cause all sorts of problems for him. As
he walked through the city he went through at an incredibly slow
pace. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once in a while, he
would come across a building with beasts inside. Although Quinn's
eyesight was incredibly handy in situations like these. The beasts
too had good eyesight in the darkness for they had lived on the
planet but his seemed to be even better than theirs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he entered the
buildings there would be cases where Quinn had spotted them far up
ahead in the darkness, he quickly would shift and hide in the shadows
or behind wall's waiting for the beasts to leave and when he was
ready, he would zoom past and around. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no direction to
go in and just simply wandering around, Quinn had already used up two
hours of his time exploring the place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The hunger in his
belly was starting to distract him and it was getting harder for him
to focus as his health had gone down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then finally, Quinn
had spotted another building that was relatively in good condition.
It was a large dome-like shape building. The training centre, a place
where Travellers could come and test out their skills or practice
with new equipment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The outside of the
dome was made with special material in case practice matches got a
bit out of hand and a stray attack would hit the outside now and
then. It was capable of withstanding attacks from some of the
strongest beasts and power level users. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No wonder it's
in good condition,&quot; Quinn said as he looked at the building. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the only
other place Quinn could think of where the portal could be kept safe.
The place was large and had a sturdy outside that was yet to be
destroyed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn got closer
to the dome building, he noticed there where several mechs stationed
outside that had been destroyed. Their cores completely ripped out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Mechs were a
powerful device used in the war but to power them they required an
incredibly powerful beast crystal of a high tier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a strange
thing because the higher power levels preferred to use their own
abilities, while the lower power levels could never afford to use
such a thing. Most of the mechs were used by the military or private
companies that hired Low-level travellers to operate the thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it was a
double-edged sword for a low-level Traveller. Usually, they would
come with contracts, if the mechs were ever destroyed then the user
would be asked to pay for them. Of course, a low level in their whole
life time could never afford to pay back something as expensive as a
mech. Causing them to forever be a slave to the company. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just another one of
the changes that had happened after the war with the Dalki. During
the War Humans were brought together to fight the common enemy but
once the treaty was signed the greed of humans were shown. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the Dalki knew
how ununited earth was at the moment, Quinn was sure earth would lose
the way it was right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's why he needed
to get stronger, to protect himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he reached the
entrance of the training centre, he could see that two Rattaclaw's
were standing out in front of the building. Before entering he
decided to walk around the large dome carefully to see if there were
any other entrances, but there were none besides the first one he had
seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He returned back to
the entrance and was hidden behind one of the destroyed mechs around
thirty meters away from the entrance. Even though he had walked
around for about thirty minutes the Rattaclaws remained there
unmoving. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He decided to wait a
little longer hoping that the Rattaclaw's might move. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as he saw the
message bring his health down once again, he was only getting even
more aggravated. The Rat's didn't look like they would be leaving any
time soon and Quinn needed to come up with a plan. </FONT></FONT>

chomp down onto his leg. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he looked down it
was one of the Rat's and the other three weren't too far behind it.
Quinn then swung his fist down as hard as he could at the Rat
smashing its skull into pieces. The Rat was forced to let go but
still wasn't dead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other three were
now too close and he no longer had any time to input the code. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn was
suddenly behind them, but he was still too close to the four Rats.
Flash step only had a distance of five meters at most. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Rats turned and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have no
choice!&quot; He held out his palm and fired. &quot;Blood burst.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A shotgun like spray
of blood was released from his hand and it had knocked back all four
of the Rat's killing the already injured one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then rushed
forward to one of the Rats on the ground, held both hands together
and slammed it down on another Rat's head killing the second one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now the other two
Rat's had recovered and were quickly after Quinn once again. Out of
desperation he swung his hands and activated his blood swipe,
although this time, the blood swipes were strong and had killed each
one in a single attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his time
running incredibly low, Quinn didn't even bother to get out the beast
crystals, there was also the fear that more beasts might be coming.
He went up to the door this time inputting the code correctly and as
he entered, he shut the door behind him making sure it was locked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was now in what
looked like a reception area, a canteen of sorts with several seats
and a desk at the front. It was in top condition compared to the rest
of the city. In fact, it looked like an entirely different place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were two
hallways one leading to the left and one leading to the right, both
with the words training centre written on them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his health
running low, he had less than two hours to find the portal. He
entered the main training hall. It was a large room with several
seats in the stands. It reminded Quinn of the game as it looked
similar. Everything was white in colour and had a modern empty look
to it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as Quinn stared
at the empty field in the centre, all he could see was
disappointment. The arena down below was completely empty. There was
not a single thing down there, not even a scrap of metal never mind a
portal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn fell to his
knees in despair. He felt like this was his last chance. There was no
way he had the time to go walking around the city looking for another
room with a portal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he didn't give
up yet. He lifted himself up the ground and searched and searched
around the training centre. He searched in the preparation rooms, the
offices, the gym and even back in the reception area. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But nothing, there
wasn't a single thing he could find. He now laid there on the floor
in the centre of the arena. Looking up at the ceiling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The pain in his
stomach was too strong, his vision was now blurring up and he could
no longer think properly or move. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So this is how
my life ends huh.&quot; Quinn said, &quot;Mum, Dad, why did you leave
me on my own, why did you give me this book. I thought when I got
this book maybe I might be able to change something but I guess not.&quot;

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some nights he was
able to sleep peacefully and dream just like any other person but
then there were times where his mind was sent to the black room. At
that time no one was sat in the chair, no one was in control. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The chair was empty,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, this is
a scary place, a kid like you shouldn't be here on their own to begin

we swap for a bit?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian then switched
places with Vorden. While Ian lay on the cold hard uncomfortable

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In almost an instant
from behind him, Vorden could hear the sound of Ian's loud snores.
Unlike him, Ian was able to get to sleep almost instantly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Vorden, so
if you aren't going to kill him now what about when we find the
portal?&quot; Raten asked. &quot;The advanced crystal he is carrying
would be very helpful to us and no one would find out. You've seen
how weak he is and now we have his ability it would be easy to finish
him off.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;While I'm in

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When doing nothing
it was hard to tell how much time had past. Vorden didn't even know
how long he had been asleep for and with the sky always showing
black, he had no way of knowing. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After waiting what
felt like an entire day, it seemed like Ian had finally woken up. As
he lifted himself off the ground, he continued to wince in pain and
hold onto his ribs. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as Ian got off
the ground, his face suddenly dropped, in one of the hole's he had
made, all that could be seen was a single large eyeball looking
through. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian immediately went
to his waist and grabbed a small dagger throwing it at the beast's
eye. Using all his strength and the added stats of the equipment he
was wearing, the dagger flew right through the eye and out the other

the dagger flew back into his hand. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's get out
of here!&quot; Ian shouted as he kicked one of the shelves knocking
it over. As the two of them climbed on top of the fallen shelf they

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All around the
library, on top of the ceiling, on the side of the walls, where
multiple slug-like creatures everywhere. They had a single large eye
on its head and sticking out of its sides were multiple tentacles
coming from the beast's underbelly. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was a little

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were too many
attacking at once, Ian then held out both of his hands with his palms
open, objects from all over the library started to vibrate. Slowly

pulled by an invisible force. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then shards of metal

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The pieces of metal
from all over the library and a few pieces from outside had come
towards the two of them and formed a ball completely made out of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast from above
fell on top of the metal ball but no damage was done as they slid
off. The tentacles from the slugs outside started to attack and made
dent's in the ball, loud clanging sounds could be heard from inside

similar to someone swinging a bat and it would only be a matter of
time before the metal ball broke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment, the
ball exploded with an incredible force, just how the scrap metal had
been pulled together, it was now being pushed out. Little pieces of
scrap metal were flung out so hard it had caused several puncture
wounds in the beast's body killing them all as it went through their
brains and hearts. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good thing

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them went
up to the dead slugs and started to carve out the crystals. At that

to activate his earth ability that he had gotten from Peter on one of

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Vorden had
agreed, he had no space to put the crystals anywhere. He hadn't
brought a bag, a pouch or a storage unit with him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After all, it was an
unexpected visit. For now, Ian said he would keep the crystals until
they returned back to earth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, it was time
for the two of them to leave the library and search for the portal
once again. The two of them made sure to not attract any beast on
their way and to their luck they hadn't come across any more dangers.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then finally the two
of them spotted something. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You see that,
now if I was going to put a portal anywhere, I would put it in
there,&quot; Ian said pointing at the large dome building. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is it?&quot;
Vorden asked, &quot;It looks like a training centre.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's exactly
what it is, and it looks like it was well built, the beast around
here haven't even been able to scratch it, and it's big enough to
build a secret base underneath.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just outside the
large dome-like building, Vorden and Ian were preparing to enter. The
front of the dome was an open field filled with all sorts of junk. It
looked like a battle had taken place outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They carefully made
their way along the field of broken rubbish and Mechs, keeping cover
while inching their way closer and closer to the entrance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After looking left
and right for any beasts nearby and seeing that there were none
there, they decided to make a dash for it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they ran forward,
they reached the hall and moved towards the door but stopped just
outside as something had caught their eye. Ian bent down to have a
closer look at something lying on the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;More dead
Rattaclaw's. Another group of them, even,&quot; Ian then dipped his
finger into the black blood. Even though it was slightly dry, it
seemed pretty new. &quot;It doesn't look like they have been dead for
long. Looks like someone's already in there.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden didn't want
to say anything but he was hoping that it was Quinn. However, as he
walked past the dead Rattaclaw's, if it really was Quinn, it seemed
like the secret he was hiding from Vorden was bigger than he thought.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A passcode
machine?&quot; Vorden said as he spotted it off to the side of the
door. &quot;Do you know the combination?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
kidding me, how the hell would I know.&quot; Ian then held out both
of his hands as he looked at the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to
concentrate. After a while, Vorden could see a vein bulging on top of
Ian's head. &quot;Damn this door, it's so strong.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian continued to use
his powers but the door was tightly shut and wasn't going to be so
easy to break. But then, slowly, the door started creaking and the
locks behind the door started to bend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the sound of the
metal door being pulled apart had attracted some unwanted attention.
Three Rattaclaws started sneaking around, following the sound until
they spotted the two humans by the entrance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ian, you
better hurry up!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just deal with
the rats yourself!&quot; Ian shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Ian put more
strength into opening the door, part of the door started to bend. But
as it started bending, the loud clanging only attracted more unwanted
attention. Soon another four Rattaclaws joined. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There's too
many!&quot; Vorden then quickly turned to the door and held his hands
out as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
doing, at least hold the back or something?&quot; Ian said, but
suddenly, the door was easier to move than before. It was being much
more responsive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Ian looked at
Vorden, he could see he too was visibly sweating. &quot;It couldn't
be?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the two of them
using their powers, they were finally able to tear the door apart
creating a hole just large enough for them to get through. They
quickly ran forward and jumped through the small gap. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now inside the
building, they turned back around and held out their hands once again
focusing all of their power. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Rattaclaw
closest to the entrance leapt forward, and its head had just managed
to get through the hole. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Close, damn
it!&quot; Vorden shouted. Just then, the door bent back, sealing the
hole and slicing the Rattaclaw's head off. A loud thump was heard as
it hit the floor and slowly rolled away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them, now
inside and with the door shut, noticed something. It was incredibly
dark inside the training centre. There were a few small white LED
lights that were placed on the floor up against the wall, but other
than that, the lights above were completely out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Ian took a step
forward, he could hear the sound of glass cracking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now why would
someone go to the trouble to take out all the lights?&quot; Ian said,
&quot;These places are built to last hundreds of years with the power
they have and the outside looked like it was untouched.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe it was
the person who came in before us?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe. Here,
take this,&quot; Ian said, as he chucked over a small pebble-like
item. Vorden noticed that it was the same item that he had used when
they had made their temporary shelter in the library. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden tapped it
once a small orange glow emitted from the stone and surrounded him.
&quot;What about you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian then pulled out
another stone, tapping it before putting it on his waist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, are you
going to tell me about what just happened, or are you going to keep
that secret as well?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden let out a
little nervous laugh. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No secrets. My
ability allows me to copy other abilities. I copied it when I saw you
use it at the library.&quot; Vorden had no reason to lie to the man.
He already knew he could use the same ability and what were the
chances that Vorden had the same rare ability as the man. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Vorden
wasn't going to reveal the fact that he needed to touch the man to
copy his abilities. That part he would keep to himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's kind of
cool. I wish I could do something like that,&quot; Ian said, &quot;Come
on let's go,&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was surprised
by the man's actions. He thought he might yell or complain that he
had done something without his permission, but this was something
that he hadn't experienced before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
continued to walk along the dark hall. For now, there was only one
direction they could go and the LED lights helped lead them the right
way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Psst, hey
Vorden, this is your last chance, switch with me now,&quot; Raten
said, &quot;If the portal's in here, I can save you the hard work and
kill him straight away.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, but that
was your last chance.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them had
finally arrived at the reception room. There were still small LED
lights placed across the room, so at least they had a sense for the
size of the room. Still, just like the previous room, the lights had
been taken out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of the lights
above were smashed in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It must have
been a beast,&quot; Ian said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What makes you
say that?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, a lot of
beasts on this planet are on a cycle. For the year it remains dark,
they go out and hunt. But when the sun comes out, they hibernate for
the year. My guess is that a beast sensitive to light managed to get
inside somehow and started to destroy them all. If it was a human
that did this, they could have just found the source of power and
shut them all off at once, or even just used the light switch.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued to
move forward until they had eventually reached the front desk. Now,
all that was left was to enter the arena and they did so, going
through one of the entrances. When they exited, they had come out
into the stands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Grahhh!&quot;
As soon as they entered, fierce growls started coming from the
hallway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quick, turn of

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it was
useless. They could hear footsteps banging against the floor as
something came rushing forward from the arena and into the stands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A humanoid figure
remained, but what was now standing in the middle of the arena was no

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It opened it's

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;REKKKKKKK!&quot;
It then let out a loud piercing screech that echoed through the large
training centre. With its eyes closed, it ran forward at an inhuman
speed and when it reached the side of the wall, it dug its claws in
and started to climb up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It quickly moved up
to the ceiling before smashing the light with its fist. The light was
now no more. With the light taken out, the Bloodsucker was now able
to open its eyes. It could see just as clear as if it was day inside.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It let go of the
ceiling, causing it to fall the ground. The drop was at least 30
meters from the top, but as it landed it bent its knees and walked
away as it had taken no damage at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Bloodsucker
started to roam around the training centre. As it entered each room,
it continued to destroy the lights. It only had room in his mind for
one thing, its need for blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After transforming
into the Bloodsucker, Quinn's thoughts, emotions, and everything that
made him human were gone, his body acted on its own and that single
thought of blood occupied him. Finally, after he had destroyed every
light in every room, he returned to the arena in the training centre.
As if it didn't know what to do, it started walking in circles,
waiting for his prey. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a few moments
later, Vorden and Ian had entered the room. Although they were quiet,
Quinn, or what was left of him anyway, could hear everything. Their
soft footsteps against the floor and even their whispers to each
other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His head turned and
saw two bright lights. At first, the light covered the humans so he
was unable to tell what they were but when they turned the lights
off, he could tell that a meal had arrived on his doorstep. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian and Vorden could
hear the sound of something running towards them, but it was too dark
to tell what it was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that they had
been discovered there was no need to stay in complete darkness. Ian
went to his belt to touch the stone but before he reached it, the
beast was already upon him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Being in the dark
had adjusted the two's eyes a little, and the LED lights going across
the edge of the arena helped. Now the beast was close enough to tell
that it had a human figure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast held
out its claws, Ian too came out with his fists. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;A battle of

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the beast's
hands had wrapped around Ian's fists and stopped them in its tracks.
Then using its nails, it dug into Ian's fists drawing out blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What monstrous
strength! Damn it, to meet a humanoid beast of all types here!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As it smelled the
blood fall from Ian's hands, it started to growl and screech even
more. It opened its mouth revealing two huge fangs. It then tried
moving its head forward, chomping down Ian's fists, but activating
all the strength in the beast equipment he was wearing, he tried
pushing the beast back and managed to stop him a little. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the beast
lifted both of its legs off the ground and kicked Ian away, causing
him to crash into a nearby wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As it saw Ian was
injured, it started to run towards him, but before it could reach
him, a metal chair from the stand came flying out and knocked the
beast away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden quickly
rushed to Ian's side and lifted him off the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was
that?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know.
I've never seen anything like it, but it looks like a humanoid-type
beast. I don't know much about them but all I know is that their one
of the most powerful types of beasts to be discovered on other
planets. This is my first time seeing one.&quot; Ian replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The chair didn't
keep the beast down for long, as the smell of blood was too strong.
It attracted the beast and as soon as it got up from the ground it
immediately started running in the direction of the two again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Turn on your
light stone!&quot; Ian said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two of them
turned on the light stone, the beast suddenly stopped. It covered its
eyes and backed away from the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
I was right,&quot; said Ian, &quot;That beast must have been the one
to take out all the lights, it looks like its super sensitive.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the two were
foolish thinking the light stones would be enough to keep the
Bloodsucker away from its prey. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast didn't
need to rely on its eyesight to know where the two were. The smell of
Ian's blood was enough. From the stands, it started to rip out the
chairs and proceed to hurl them at the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily, the chairs
were made out of a metal material, so Ian and Vorden were able to
repel them away. The chairs continued to be chucked at an incredible
rate as each one was ripped from the stands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the beast
decided to rush forward with its eyes closed. As it got close to the
two, it started to attack them blindly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How does it
know where we are?&quot; Ian said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden get out

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can't you see,
the beast is only attacking Ian, something is attracting it to Ian.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Raten's words,
Vorden decided to break away from Ian and ran down to the arena floor
and just like he said, the beast had completely ignored Vorden and
continued to attack at Ian. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You had your

yourself Vorden.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a new voice was
heard from within. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian and the beast
continued to do battle. Unfortunately for Ian, the only source of
metal he could control in the arena were the chairs and it took him
some time to attract those things toward him. He would rip two chairs
out from the stands and would use them as shield blocking the beast's
attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, every time
the beast would hit with its fist, it would completely tear through
the chairs. The attacks were too powerful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the beast leapt
through the air with its fangs wide open. Ian had no choice but to
shove his forearm into the beast mouth, hoping to avoid a fatal blow.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian could feel the
beast sucking onto his arm. He wanted to push and hit the beast off
him but as soon as the fangs penetrated his skin, it felt like he was
under a paralysis effect, and his body was unable to move. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast was
busy feasting on its meal, it was unable to notice the sharp object
flying towards it. Like a spear, a flying metal object had come out
and pierced the beast's shoulder. The blow was fast and powerful,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The paralysis effect
from the Bloodsucker was slowly starting to wear off and as it did,
Ian lifted himself off the ground to have a look at just what was
going on. In the centre of the arena, the area was lit up by the
small glow stone where Vorden was standing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he wasn't just
standing there on his own, he had multiple chairs that had been taken
from the arena surrounding him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How is he able
to use the ability so well already? Even I would struggle to do
something like this if I was in top condition. Didn't he only copy my
ability a while ago?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the bloodsucker
lifted himself off the ground, he pulled the metal object that had
been lodged into his shoulder and dropped it onto the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Rakkkk!&quot;
The Bloodsucker snarled out, its attention was now fully focused on
what had caused him pain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead of going in
straight for an attack and charging in though, the Bloodsucker dug
it's claw into the wall and started to climb upwards. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How are we
meant to see him now?&quot; said Vorden. &quot;It's too dark and the
beast can attack from anywhere.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have no time
to play games.&quot; The little one said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He lifted his hands
and started to crumble up each of the chairs into several metal
spikes all looming above his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then he waited, the
beast jumped down from above and as soon as the little one could hear
and see him, he immediately repelled all the spikes in that
direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as the
beast was falling through the air and the first spike came towards
him, it spun around and grabbed the spike throwing it back at an
incredible speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the little one
had prepared for this too. He had already gathered a pile of chairs
from the arena and mushed them together to form a shield. He placed
this on the ground so he could easily pick it up when needed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the spike came
towards him, he lifted the shield but what he didn't expect was the
blow to be so powerful, that the spike had managed to still penetrate
the shield he created, which was at least 6 inches thick with metal
chairs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hahaha!&quot;
Raten started laughing, &quot;Looks like I really missed out on this
one, did you see how strong it was? I would have loved to deal with
this guy. Vorden you would have been killed within seconds.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the beast
was able to throw back one spear, while in the air he was unable to
move. The other spears that were targeted, had managed to penetrate
him, going through his body and sticking him to the ceiling of the
dome. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast no longer
caring for the damage that had been done to its own body, it lifted
its legs up against the ceiling and pushed with all its strength
allowing the spikes to completely go through his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the hole
marks that could be seen in his body quickly healed up. All though it
didn't add to the beast's health it would still allow him to fight as
if he had never been hurt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He landed in the
arena stands and began hitting a few chairs as he landed. As soon as
it stood up it began to rush forward recklessly towards Vorden's
direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This thing,
why isn't it dead yet!&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few more chairs
had been turned into metallic spikes and he threw them towards the
beast once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time the beast
continued to run forward and moved out of the way of each spike. Its
eyes were slowly adjusting to the light that had surrounded Vorden
and now it could see the spikes as it left his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon the spike
left Vorden's side, the beast would react and move out of the way of
each blow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it me or
did that thing just get faster,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is bad,
the little one isn't at full strength.&quot; Raten added, &quot;If
only there were two more ability user's nearby.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Bloodsucker
continued to move forward avoiding each and every spike thrown at it,
then when it was close enough it swung it's claw out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shield was
raised blocking the blow, but as the claw hit the shield it was
completely shattered unable to be used again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now with no more
metal surrounding the little one, the beast was able to freely
attack. As it took a step forward though, it felt something sharp
pierce into its foot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the beast looked
down it was another metal spike. It looked in the distance and
noticed that Ian had managed to recover. He had his hand held out and
had thrown the spike out into the beast leg. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly though,
tears started to fall from the little one's face. Now that the beast
was close enough, the light from the stone shown and reviled the face
and clothes of the beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast in front
of him was wearing the same uniform, and although it didn't look
exactly like Quinn, it had similar qualities in its face. He didn't
know what happened to make Quinn turn into a creature like this but
he could feel that the beast and Quinn was the same person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I've done it
again, I have hurt another one.&quot; The little one said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
doing!&quot; Ian shouted, &quot;Kill it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian then crumpled up
another nearby chair and threw out another spike, this time aiming
for the beast's head. It came flying through the sky and was on
target to hit but before it did, it stopped mid-air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No!&quot; The
little one then moved its hand throwing the spike to one side, then
using its other hand it pulled the other spike out of its leg. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The beast was now
free to move around. It instantly looked at the last person who had
hit him and immediately started to run towards Ian's direction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian was still under
the effects of the paralysis when he had thrown the previous spike.
When he threw the spike, he had originally aimed for the beast's head
but missed. He still managed to luckily hit its foot though. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing the beast
quickly running towards him as every second passed. he panicked and
started to fling out chair after chair but the Bloodsucker was too
powerful. It simply knocked them away with its hands sending them
flying through the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ian then pulled out
his trusty dagger ready to attack but when he looked in front of him
the beast had vanished from his view, the next second he was staring
up at the ceiling with his back on the floor. Then when he looked
down at his body his legs were now completely detached from himself,
blood pouring from them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Bloodsucker then
dragged the top half of Ian's body away into the hallway out of the
arena, afraid that the other person might disturb its meal. </FONT></FONT>

started to twitch hearing Earls rotten attitude and tone in his

out of the city by now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

annoyed, there was nothing she could do, she wanted to stand her
ground and beat the information out of them, but Earl was a lever

something else on her mind. Did Peter really push Vorden into the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter I
thought they were your friends, you know, every day Quinn would ask
about how you were to me. He told me that if I ever saw anything

they would go after you, Erin or Vorden. No of course not, they would
go after me. So you say you can protect me but for how long? Could
you keep an eye on me twenty-four hours of the day and then what
happens when I leave this academy and you guys aren't there. My whole

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside one of the
meeting rooms located in the first-year building. A meeting had been
called. Currently sitting at the head of the table was Nathan and by
his side was Fay, who had been in charge of the investigation of the
missing two students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they waited,
several other teachers started to enter the room. Del, who was Vorden

and finally Hayley the school's doctor. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nathan didn't want
word to spread out about what had happened since the 1st year
students were his responsibility. Therefore, he called his most

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

Nathan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay then stood up

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you have
been made aware, two of our students have gone missing and due to
that, we have had to delay the first year's outing. However, if this
was a simple missing persons case we would not have called you all
out here today.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay then pressed a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The missing

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How or why we
do not know but one of the students was Vorden Blade. An original
from a powerful family. The mission is not to bring him back alive
but to at least bring his body back. That way the family can say
their goodbyes and it should calm down their anger.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The other
student is not a priority; he goes by the name of Quinn Talen. A weak
level one with no family an orphan. There is no need to worry about
him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
where the portal leads to?&quot; Hayley asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you can see
in the diagram the red portal leads to an abandoned planet named
Pioletic. It was one of the very first planets the human race had
ever created a shelter on. It was safe for the most part but as the
place was filled with weak beasts. However, that was until a year had
passed and nightfall had come. Beasts stronger than we had ever seen
before came and attacked the shelter, we had no choice but to abandon
the place.&quot; Fay explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is why we
have called you four,&quot; Nathan said as he stood up. &quot;The
four of you will head out through the red portal immediately. Don't
worry our latest reports say that the beasts that attacked the
shelter have long since moved on. The place is mostly filled with
Rattaclaw scum and the odd intermediate beast here and there.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del then slammed his
fist onto the table. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why should we
risk our lives for a couple of students who may have just jumped into
the portal themselves.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Would you like
to be the one to go to the Blade family and explain to them why their
son has died and gone missing. How even though we insisted on these
watches, to keep track of where they are we still weren't able to
keep an eye on them.&quot; Nathan said, &quot;This is an order, not a
request.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, Layla was
still worrying over Quinn. Now that she knew he had most likely gone
through a portal, her worries only started to double. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry
too much,&quot; Erin said. &quot;If Vorden is with him, he will
protect his friend. Of course, unless they went through a red portal
that is. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But she was more
worried that Vorden might be used as an emergency ration during the
trip more than anything. Without any food or water supplies with
them, Perhaps Quinn would suck him dry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they were walking
through the hallway, they noticed that a group of students were
gossiping and as they walked past, they heard Vorden's name being
mentioned. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What did you
say?&quot; Layla asked, &quot;Would you mind repeating that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We were just
talking about the missing students, Dumbo here has the ability of
super hearing and had heard in on the meeting saying that Vorden was
stuck on a Red portal planet.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing those

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn, maybe I

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you
remember anything else, the name of the planet, if another student
went with them?&quot; Erin said now shaking Dumbo who was standing
next to the female student. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;um Yeah they
said the planets name was Pioletic, and they said something about
Quinn being there as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then got out
of Dumbo's face and immediately started rushing towards her room. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wonder what
that was all about.&quot; With her two teammates stuck in another
world and nothing else for Erin to now do. She decided she would
continue training while she waited for them to return. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had rushed off
towards her dorm room as quick as she could after hearing about what
planet they were on. As she entered the room, she locked the door
behind her and placed a chair on the handle. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her roommate luckily
wasn't in at the moment which meant she was free to do what she had
planned. She then bent down under her bed and pulled out a small
little box. As she opened the box a circular black sphere shape ball
was inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I already
checked the room for any microphones and there didn't seem to be
any.&quot; said Layla, &quot;I guess the other families really did
put pressure on them not to invade privacy so much.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She then tapped the
top of the sphere and a clicking sound was heard. A white ring
started to light up and went around in circles for a few seconds
before it finally completely lit up. </FONT></FONT>

leave you, although the AI system will help you answer any questions
you have about the system, it is not able to go beyond that, so here
are my final recorded words. I'm sorry but now that you are a
vampire, others will come looking for you. They have already blended
into society so it's almost impossible to tell who is one and who
isn't. If you want to live a life of freedom as I did, then get
stronger, create a force of your own and fight back. Good luck my

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Around ten minutes
had passed since Vorden had last heard Quinn say anything. But he
preferred this over the screaming Quinn. Before he felt like at any
second, a rampage might start-up from him, but right now, he was
relaxed and no longer had his handheld up holding the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He lent up against
the door with his back propped up against it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, what are
we still doing here?&quot; Raten asked. &quot;Any second now that guy
could be eating us, I don't understand.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But he isn't,
is he?&quot; Vorden replied, &quot;Do you think he couldn't have
eaten us just now, to be honest, I don't even think me holding up the
door with my ability would have been enough to stop him.&quot; He
then lifted his hand across his chest; the wound had dried up and was
starting to scab over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, movement from
the other side of the door was heard as Quinn started to lift himself
up from the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, you
still there?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I'm

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I'm
okay, you probably want to know what just happened don't you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I would
be lying if I said no.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then took a
deep breath as he prepared to tell Vorden the whole tail. It was hard
for him. Unlike Layla, who had been so accepting of it, not everyone
was like her, and he was afraid of Vorden's reaction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He slowly started at
the beginning about how he had obtained a book, and after using it
felt different all of a sudden. Quinn then went on to explain the
events at school and even things that happened with Layla. All up to
the point where he had arrived in the portal world, eventually
turning into the Bloodsucker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were some
details he decided to leave out, though. There was no reason for him
to reveal anything about the system or the blonde-haired man, but he
did tell Vorden about how he grew stronger the more blood he had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These mysteries were
his own problem to deal with, and only he only needed to tell Vorden
what he needed to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was silence
between the two for a few moments as Quinn finished his story. Vorden
was, of course, shocked by the whole thing. Vampires, he didn't even
know there were such things, and if Quinn had told him this before,
he would have thought he had gone mad. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Vorden had seen
it, he had seen what Quinn had turned into, and Ian's dead body in
the room was proof of that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know, I
knew you were different from the moment I met you,&quot; said Vorden.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
how abilities work? Every person has a number of mutant cells inside
their body that they can activate. The more cells a person can
activate, the stronger their ability level. My ability allows me to
replicate these cells from one person into my own body. That's why if
someone is only a level one earth user, I can only copy the same
number of mutant cells from them. But when I shook your hand, I felt
the different cells in your body Quinn, just for whatever reason I
couldn't replicate them. It tried and tried forming and breaking
down, but every time they would end up in failure. it was the first
time something like that had ever happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you scared
of me, Vorden?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Scared, Quinn,
everyone has their own secrets that they don't want others to know,
some more so than others. It's understandable why you hid it, the
Government, military and the big families would all be trying to get
their hands on you trying to use your power for themselves.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then turned
around and moved the metal door out and into the corridor. The metal
door was placed to the side, and when he lifted his face, his mouth
remained wide open. To his surprise, Quinn looked almost like a
completely different person. He had a whole new energy surrounding
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had grown a
few inches in height, his skin looked super smooth and had gone
slightly pale. While his face looked a little more masculine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now this might
be a tough one to explain?&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving the
room, Vorden went to check on Ian's body. He continued to search and
search but could find no sign of the advanced tier crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But what he did see
was two bite marks on the neck of Ian. Right now, Quinn looked
completely normal but looking at the bite marks on Ian's neck. It
reassured him that everything Quinn said was the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them went
looking around until they had come across a toilet. Inside was a
mirror for Quinn to look at himself. The changes weren't so drastic
that you couldn't tell it was Quinn, but it looked like he had just
gone on a 12-week model training course. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued to
walk around and ended back in the arena where the two of them fought.
The two looked at the mess they had caused, Quinn thinking about when
he was a Bloodsucker and Vorden thinking about the little one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were scraps of
metal all over the place, multiple broken chairs and across the floor
Blood. For now, Quinn was full from his last meal, and he also had
managed to fill up his Blood bank. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Based on Ian's
information, the portal was most likely to be in this building, a
secret switch of some sort hidden somewhere but the two of them had
no clue where that would be. After searching around for a while and
no success, the two of them sat down on the arena floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn asked why
Vorden was even here in the first place, and was given the simple
reply of &quot;I came after you.&quot; Although they didn't stay on
the subject for long as it seemed Vorden kept steering away from the
conversation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn assumed it had
something to do with Peter, and right now that was the last person
the two of them wanted to speak about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when Vorden
stomach started to growl; it had been a while since he had eaten the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Aren't you?&quot;
For a second, there was another awkward silence between the two. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;if you want I

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
started to laugh and joke about a few things as time passed by. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a shame

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn could
try pass of the vampire abilities as something normal, there was the
problem that there was no skill like it. They would immediately
assume he was an original. And there was now something that worried
him even more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the video the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden
continued to search the arena for some type of secret exit, Quinn was
pretending to look for one as well while walking around. Instead, he
wanted to inspect the ability book he had received earlier from the
metal container. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as he
thought about his inventory, a screen appeared in front of him. Then
when just thinking about the item, the system would come up with a
message. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Would you like to
take out the Level 6 Shadow ability book?] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time rather
than a monotone robotic voice the system usually played in his head.
It was the annoying energetic blonde man's voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Level 6 shadow
book, can only be learnt by those that have been Blooded] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn used his
inspect skill, a weird word had been added at the end. Blooded? Was
that another name for Vampires perhaps? When Quinn tried the other
ability books, he wasn't able to learn any of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It started to make
Quinn ask more questions about the book. Why did the military keep
such a high-level book locked away? Was it because everyone had died
or were they planning to sell it off for the future? Either way, he
had never heard of someone possessing a shadow ability before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, the
annoying voice was heard again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So it looks
like you want to learn more about the book, huh? well, I can tell you
if you want, do you want to know?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The AI system seemed
to be just as annoying as the man himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please?&quot;
Quinn said while gritting his teeth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Your guess is
correct, blooded refers to those that have been blessed or cursed
whichever way you want to look at it, with Vampire blood. It doesn't
matter if there, a halfling, a vampire lord, or even a ghoul. As long
as they possess some of the vampire's blood, they are able to learn
these abilities.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
why the book was here?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The AI system had
surprisingly answered in great detail. It was like the blonde man
said. While the inspect skill was able to tell him information about
items, his system would clarify things to him related to the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was still
unsure about whether to learn it or not as he still needed more
information, and it seemed like the AI was the perfect person to ask.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is this the
only ability book Vampires can learn? And can Vampires learn more
than one ability?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just like
humans, Vampires are only able to learn one ability. Whether or not
there are other ability books out there like this, who knows, there
may be some stronger, they may be some weaker.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The AI system was
only an AI system after all. Even though the man sounded intelligent
with a stupid voice, it was limited to what it could answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was if
this truly was another ability that Quinn was unable to use in the
outside world, he didn't want it. Another ability that the world
didn't know about meant he would be targeted. However, the question
remained if there even was an ability that vampires could use as well
as Humans. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had asked the
AI more questions hoping to get an answer it had no clue and would
just reply back with sarcastic answers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that being
said, there was one person in the room that was knowledgeable about
these things, and he might just know about the shadow ability.
Vorden. Although the system stated blooded were the only ones that
could learn it, maybe there were other Vampires out there that had
used the ability before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two pasted by
each other while making their rounds around the stadium, Quinn popped
the question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, have
you ever heard of an ability that uses shadows?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shadows,
honestly my gut instinct would be no or at least not the world
anyway, but you were honest with me so its time I'll be honest with
you.&quot; said Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
sat down a few chairs apart in the stadium, one of the rows that
hadn't been trashed form the fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Remember when
I said earlier how I kept an eye on you because I couldn't copy your
ability, well you're not the first one. Or not the first one in our
family,&quot; said Vorden. &quot;As you know I'm an original, so our
powers have been passed down from generation to generation for
hundreds of years. In my great grandfather's journal, there was a
time he said he had come across another user with an ability. Now
back then this was rare, the whole world still didn't know Humans had
super capabilities. But each time we would come across one, our
family would log it, especially since our ability relied on others.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For the first
time, he had come across someone's ability, he couldn't copy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So is that why
you were so interested in me?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden's face
started to go a little red as he was embarrassed hearing those words.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When you say
it like that it sounds a little strange, I assure you I don't think
of you in that way.&quot; Vorden said awkwardly. But then his face
went serious. &quot;Now that I told you, tell me, how would something
the public not know about, would you know about? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the moment Quinn
lifted the ability book in his hand which had the words shadow
Ability written across it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a second, Vorden
had to rub his eyes to check he wasn't seeing things. He thought
perhaps Quinn might have learnt something when he turned into a
Vampire about it but to actually have the ability book in his hand
itself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whoa you
actually found it, I was sure it would have been an original skill,
but there was actually an ability book. Well, what are you waiting
for let's learn it now! We have all the time in the world, and we're
stuck here doing nothing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well I really
did want to learn it, but the problem is if I did others would be
after me just like they would for the vampire ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden started to
think long and hard if there was anything he could do to help him.
Then his master plan had come to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think we can
use the situation we're into your advantage,&quot; said Vorden. &quot;The
school must know by now that we have been sent to another planet. A
red portal planet at that. There are things that have been
undiscovered on these planets all the time. You can just say you
found the book here, that you learnt it for your survival, they all
know your level one trash.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden paused for a
moment after saying those words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I mean, they
all think you're just a level one right? I'll say while we were in
the portal world, I protected you, and as payment, after learning the
skill, you decided to hand the book over to me. That way the people
will no longer be bugging you for it but my family instead.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden smiled as if
he had just cracked the toughest case in a Mystery Novel. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you sure
your family will be okay with that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a split second,
Quinn thought he had seen Vorden's face drop, but when he blinked and
looked again, it was completely normal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, they'll
be fine, with the plan or set let's get to learning that ability
book. I can't wait to see the faces of everyone when we get out of
here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

stood opposite each other in the centre of the stadium. Not too far
from each other so they could hear each other without having the need

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Everyone knows
about the power level system, there are eight levels in total. These
levels are actually determined by how many mutant cells you are able
to activate in your body and not actually determined by strength.
Let's take the earth ability as an example, someone with a low number
of cells is only able to transform the earth they can hold in their
hand. While a level 5 earth user might be able to lift the earth from
the ground without touching it. These types of ability books contain
information on how to activate more mutant cells for your specific
type of ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But if the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good
question,&quot; said Vorden. &quot;The test the military gives you is
actually to put you into the subcategories they created, the 1.1 1.2

well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then lifted
up his wristwatch and showed him the number currently displayed which

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;These watches
are the answer. The watches they put on us are able to determine the
number of mutant cells in our body. Before even taking the test, they
knew what level we were at. They simply just set the watches to an
off mode the moment we arrived. When I use my ability, I also copy
the number of mutant cells in their body, which is why the watch now
shows the number six.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

further confirmed that Quinn being a Vampire, wasn't an ability. The
number on his watch had never changed, or maybe it was the fact that
his cells were no longer human. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Think about
it, not every test is able to determine someone's strength. Some
abilities allow you to tell if someone is telling the truth, some
allow super hearing and some can help you see into the future.
Although these might not be strong fighting abilities themselves,
they require a high number of Mutant cells to activate in the first
place and now that brings me to your book.&quot; Vorden said as he
pointed towards it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not everyone
can activate a high number of cells. Some ability books are just too
high for people to learn, they try and try, but they will never be
able to succeed. To put it simply, their fate was decided for them at
birth. It might take a while before we can tell if you have the
ability to learn it or not&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It sounded harsh but
what Vorden was saying was true. He had heard examples of rich CEOs
who had bought their kids high-level ability books, only to be
disappointed when they weren't able to succeed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now we move
onto the second problem, even though you have the ability book, what
about skill books? With no skills, you will most likely only be able
to unlock 1/10th of its power. But don't let that get you down. The
ability books and skill books are only shortcuts to learning these
things in the first place. When the originals discovered their
powers, they had no books, they learnt and discovered everything
themselves.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought about
everything Vorden had said, he further went on to explain that each
book would explain a technique that could be used to Mutate a
specific type of cell. The higher the ability book, the more
information it would reveal about the method used. Some abilities
just didn't have lower levels and required people to have a high
number of mutant cells to use them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was another
little bit of information he revealed but decided to not go into too
much detail. It was the fact that your Soul weapon also had something
to do with the number of Mutated cells in your body as well. This
would determine how strong of a soul weapon you had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The example Vorden
gave was Momo. Although Momo's ability wasn't too strong in a fight,
he's soul weapon was incredibly powerful as a level 6 ability user. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had explained
that learning a level 6 ability book of the bat would take months to
learn, but while here they could get a head start. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn thought
differently. There was one thing Vorden didn't know, and it was his
Vampire abilities also worked like a system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He touched the book

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The book then lifted
into the air, and the pages started turning and flashing in front of
him. Suddenly there was the sense of Deja vu. Vorden stood on the
side line and took a step back, he had never seen anything like this
happen before. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ability book had
vanished once again, just like the old book he had received. This
time he had also been given an entirely new tab that was dedicated
only to his Shadow ability in his system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Quinn,
what's wrong, did something happen? Where's the book!&quot; Vorden
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went to
tap his head a couple of times with his finger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Inside? said
Vorden &quot;What, you mean it's inside your head?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was surprised
but at the same time not, he had learnt so many crazy things today,
and this one was probably one of the least shocking. He could imagine
that maybe whoever created the shadow book might have put a condition
on it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Maybe once it was
learnt to vanish or disappear, it would also explain why many weren't
found or how none were sold on the market. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden didn't ask
too many questions and gave Quinn a few moments to sit down and rest,
he didn't really understand what he meant by it was all inside his
head. Of course, this was Quinn's way of getting around telling
Vorden it was a system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing he
decided to do was check out his stats screen. One of the messages had
stated he had obtained a new stat called Mutant Cells or MC for
short. Looking at his MC stat, it currently displayed 100/100. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System, can
you explain the MC stat is to me?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ho, ho,&quot;
A cheery voice said, &quot;The MC stat is how many Mutant cells you
currently have in your body. Every time you use your ability, the MC
numbers will go down but worry not, for it will auto regenerate
itself over time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then looked at
the two stat points he had obtained. One form levelling up to level
10 and then the other from when he had consumed Ian's blood. But when
he tried to see what he could do with them; he was unable to increase
his MC points. Meaning it was a similar stat to his HP. The question
was whether it would increase on its own like his HP. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can tell you
the answer to that&quot; The system said. &quot;The answer is no,
those mutant cells have a cap in your body. This can only be
increased by a certain technique specific to the Shadow ability. You
would either have to find a higher-Level ability book or a teacher.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that said,
Quinn decided to put his stat points into Strength and agility as he
has been doing so far. Right now, he only had one skill that required
the use of Charm, and he didn't know how useful it would be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he increased each
stat point, he could feel the changes in his body ever so slightly,
the feeling was starting to become addictive. But he was still a long
way off from the others. Erin, who was a level 5 ability user, was
able to produce a score of fifty on the strength test. That was also
without the use of any beast gear to improve herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden was
still giving him space and walking around the room, it also gave
Quinn the time to check out a few of the other things he had unlocked
earlier. First, there was a new tutorial video. There was a single
video called combination skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video was a long
watch as it took time to explain the process. Quinn didn't have time
to watch it now and would watch it later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next thing was
the shop tab. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When selecting this
tab, he was able to search by category, and there was a whole bunch
of items, Weapons, armour, Rings, and all sorts, but there were no
skill books or ability books. The only problem was all of the items
were greyed out, not allowing him to select any of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To the side of the
screen, it showed his inventory, where he had 16 basic tier crystals,
one intermediate crystal and also an advanced tier crystal as well.
He didn't know when he had obtained them, but at some point, he must
have done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Was it while I
was a Bloodsucker?&quot; but Quinn couldn't remember killing anything
other than… Ian. It was the only explanation, when he had murdered
Ian did all his crystals transfer over into his system? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The section to the
right allowed him to select the item, he first chose the Rattaclaw
crystals. The shop auto sorted itself and gave a message in the
centre. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, when selecting
the other two crystals items had appeared up in the centre this time.
Although these items were still greyed out, but Quinn now knew the
reason why. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[3 intermediate

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The items required
several crystals to make them. After searching through the shop more,
He realised there were some weapons and items that only needed a
number of crystals. While others were more specific and needed a
specific type of beast crystal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When selecting the
advanced tier crystal, the shop auto sorted itself once again, and a
ring was shown on screen. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was a fantastic
discovery. While Quinn was planning to create an outfit that
completely blocked out the sun, there was a ring in the shop that had
the same effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only problem was
it required him to kill 10 of these Deathbat's which were advanced
tier beasts. Thinking back to how he had nearly died from the
intermediate beast, there was no way he would attempt to kill an
advanced tier beast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then there was a
second problem, Beasts, especially on the higher tiers, were Quite
specific to what planet they lived on. At some point, if Quinn wanted
to earn the ring from the shop, he would have to come back to this
planet through the portal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All in all, the shop
was a good find. Quinn started to question the AI system further on
how the shop worked, and he had explained that as long as he brought
the items that it asked for, it would be able to auto-create it and
give it to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was another
excellent find, as usually after obtaining beast crystals you would
have to take it to a beast weapons crafter who would charge for the
making of the item. Then a question hit Quinn's mind. Crystals could
only be turned into one type of item which all had the same effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The quality of the
item created would depend on the crafter, but if the item was
destined to be a ring, a sword was unable to be crafted from the same
type of crystal. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Did Ian know what

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no way of
getting any of the items from the shop, for now, he decided it was
time for him to check out the shadow tab. A whole new section of his
system that had been added as soon as he obtained the Ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Underneath the tab
was a list of around ten different skills. Each one greyed out apart
from the two skills he had learned previously. Below he could scroll
down further, but everything just appeared as several question marks.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[This skill will

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If only I had
this skill sooner!&quot; Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back in the storage
room, there were many items that Quinn wished to bring with him.
There were multiple skill books and ability books that he had already
converted into exp and wouldn't be able to gain anything again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the time he
wished to bring them with him to at least sell on the market place,
but was unable to carry them. If he wanted to do that now, it meant
leaving from the safety of the training centre, and heading back
outside were the beasts where. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn's system
allowed him to store crystals and specific ability books inside, it
did not allow him to store anything else. So the Dimensional storage
was a great skill to have. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The description was
short and didn't really reveal much. Even if he could control his own
Shadow, what use was that? But the significant difference with this
skill compared to the last skill, was the fact that it had a level by
the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it was like
Quinn's blood skills then as long as he carried on using it, it would
eventually level up. Maybe even allowing him to create shadows or use
his own shadows. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then looked at
the skills tab again. At the moment, he was able to see ten skill in
total while the rest were covered. Next to each skill was a number. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were multiple
skills, but shadow cloak was the only one that he was able to unlock
right now. He only had received ten skill points and wondered how he
would be able to obtain more. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Judging by its name,
perhaps the skill would be able to surround him like some type of
Shadow. He started to wonder if it would also be able to block out
the sunlight, which made him feel so weak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His excitement got
the better of him, and as long as he could unlock the other skills
later on, what was there to worry about? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't exactly
what he was expecting, but it seemed like it was a type of
invisibility cloak, one that would work well on beasts that were weak
but not those of a higher level. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then stood up
from the ground and was ready to test out his skills. He could see
that Vorden was still walking around the stadium, seeing if he could
find anything. It was hard for Vorden to see due to the lights being
broken, and he didn't have the same type of vision as Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That meant the whole

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now when looking
from the outside, a strange foggy like mist could be seen covering
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn walked
around the arena, he could see that his MC Stat was like a bar, while
using the skill it was slowly going down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He crept up slowly
to Vorden in the stands going between the chairs, and it seemed his
skill was working. While Quinn was stood around 10 meters apart, it
looked like Vorden had no idea he was there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But then when he
took another step closer, Vorden immediately jumped back and
attracted a chair into his hand. </FONT></FONT>

disrupting the flow around him. The hairs on his body were standing
up. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when he
concentrated, he could see something shifting in the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden went to repel
the chair, throwing it in Quinn's direction. The chair flew right
past and into the stands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey wait,

could be seen ducked down. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell
Quinn, you almost gave me a heart attack, do you not remember just

complained, &quot;I've been on high alert since.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry,&quot;
Quinn said as he let out a little nervous laugh. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But man, you
already know how to use the shadow ability already? And that seemed
like a skill?&quot; Vorden asked, amazed. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, it would

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">17-21 minutes</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was wondering
what the blood ritual was, after all, there wasn't much information
revealed about it. But now that the system was offering for Vorden to
become a blooded one, it all became clear to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a ritual that
would allow Vorden to turn into some type of vampire. Underneath the
skill, it also had the number 0/2. This would assume that at most, he
was only able to turn two people. This number might increase in the
future, but for now, that was how it was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't just
turn Vorden into a vampire, he would have to deal with the same crap
that I had to deal with.&quot; Quinn thought, &quot;Maybe I needed it
to make myself stronger, but for Vorden who was already strong,
there's no upside.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A thought then came
into his mind. The blonde man in the video had told him to grow his
own army, and soon others would come for him. Was this what he was
talking about? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end though,
Quinn decided it wasn't his decision to make. Vorden had helped big
time, and if he wanted to, then it was his choice. And it would be
nice to have people to go through this with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Vorden, if
you had the option, or let's say I could turn you into a Vampire,
would you?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't want
to hurt your feelings or anything like that, but the answer would be
no,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;Being weak for most of the day, sure
it's fine while we're on a planet like this but… besides what would
happen to my ability?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn waited for the
AI to answer his concern. The AI actually started to seem smarter
than he first thought. From what he said earlier and also giving him
the option to use his skill. Meant it was listening in on everything
that was being said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, I can
see you're waiting for an answer, His whole cell structure would
change, and he would then become a vampire. Or something like one
anyway. Which yes would mean he would no longer have his ability. Not
only that, but it might be a while before he could learn one as
well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You didn't
learn the shadow ability the conventional way, there is no longer an
ability book to learn from. It would be nearly impossible for you to
teach it to him. Then you would have to wait until you found an
ability book compatible with your Vampire cells.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, sorry
Vorden, it probably would get rid of your ability&quot;, Quinn said
scratching the back of his head. &quot;I just thought I would ask;
you might have been one of those types obsessed with Vampires.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There are
people like that?&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
started to head down the stadium floor, an area that was designed for
combat. They had been looking around the room for an hour now, and it
seemed like they were unable to find a place where the portal could
be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They needed to make
a decision. Whether or not to leave the training centre and head
outside to look for another place. But before deciding any of that,
Quinn wanted to get the hang of his new skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was also
interested and thought he might be able to help since he had
experience with using elemental abilities before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first test was
his dimensional storage skill. Just like with his other skills, all
he needed to do was think about it in his head, and it would
activate. While activated, the shadow from his own body started to
wiggle and swirl about a bit. It looked like an ocean continually
moving. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using a piece of
metal he grabbed earlier, he slowly pushed it into his shadow, and
the object started to sink in until it eventually disappeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's kinda
neat&quot;, Vorden said watching. &quot;Can you get it back out?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then placed
his hand into his shadow, as he did his arm sunk into it, but he
could feel nothing. He then thought of the piece of metal, and
suddenly he could feel something in his hand, he pulled and out came
the piece of scrap metal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two continued to
do more tests with the dimensional storage. Quinn found out that not
only his shadow could be used to gain access to things but also
Vorden's shadow or any shadow cast by the wall and buildings. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn touched
these shadows, they too would start to wiggle like his own shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next test was to
see if they could store items bigger then the shadow itself. Vorden
gathered a bunch of chairs from the stadium and formed them into one
giant flat metal circle. Then Quinn placed one hand on the circle
while the other on his shadow to store the item. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shadow
underneath his foot started to expand into the shadow created by the
large circle. Eventually, the whole thing dropped inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like the
size of the item did not matter, and the good thing was it didn't
take up any MC to use it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next skill as
the one Quinn was looking forward to the most. Shadow Control, a
skill that didn't say much in terms of description. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>[Shadow Control lv.1
active] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then inside Quinn's
mind, something had clicked. He felt like he had a new set of arms he
could control. The shadow underneath his legs was alive, and could
freely move about. He lifted the shadow, and it was like a dark
moving mist that continually surrounded him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess the
skill is limited to just the shadow around you for now. It's like a
level 1 earth ability,&quot; said Vorden. &quot;I wonder why it needs
so many mutant cells to activate and is considered a level 6.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using the shadow
around him, Quinn was able to extend it out and lift the small piece
of metal that he pulled from his dimension earlier. It was like
controlling another person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After using it for a
while, Quinn seemed to get the hang of it. He could move the shadow
to go anywhere around his body, or he could form it into whatever he
liked. Even weapons but when changing it into a sword-like shape and
trying to cut the metal, it did nothing but go around it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like the
shadow sword did not have the same properties. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, now that
you got the hang of it, you want to spar a little?&quot; Vorden
asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Having the shadow
just active and moving about didn't take much MC. It only took about
one point of MC per minute. Which meant he could play about and
activate the shadow for around an hour and a half if he didn't use
any other skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This didn't change,
no matter what he did with the shadow. However, there did seem to be
one downside. While he was using his Shadow control skill, he was
unable to cast Shadow cloak or even use his Shadow dimension. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shadow
underneath him was no longer there and was being controlled. If he
activated shadow dimension, the shadow would immediately fall to his
feet again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now the two of them
stood opposite each other ready to have a friendly fight. Vorden this
time had a couple of metal balls hovering around him instead of
spikes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Be careful
Quinn, although these might not be like the spikes, they can still do
a lot of damage.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's alright
Vorden, my body can handle it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not using his full
strength Vorden repelled the ball at a decent speed heading towards
Quinn, at that moment he lifted the shadow from his feat to form a
type of wall. As the two made an impact, the ball seemed to slow
down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It started sinking
through the shadow slowly, then part of it could be seen from the
other side. Quinn stared at the ball carefully, and then when the
ball had nearly passed through the shadow wall, it started to
accelerate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ball left the
shadow wall and slammed right into Quinn's stomach falling to the
ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Argh!&quot;
Quinn shouted as he tried to breathe in some air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I wasn't
expecting that,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Try again.&quot;
Quinn groaned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then fired
the second ball of metal and once again Quinn lifted up his shadow
shield, and the same result had appeared. Only this time Quinn moved
to the side allowing the shadow to stay where it was before moving
the shadow, the ball then carried on moving forward and banged into
the stadium wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's see how
physical attacks work,&quot; Vorden said as he moved forward and
swung a long metal pipe he had in his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Using the shadow
Quinn blocked again, and the same thing happened, however, Vorden was
easily able to pull the object away from the shadow and attack in a
new place. He also noticed that the shadow was only covering Quinn's
front and was not big enough to go around his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he was to use his
attract skill on one of the metal balls, he would easily be able to
hurt Quinn right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden continued to
attack with the metal pipe, and Quinn continued to block moving the
shadow in the areas where Quinn was attacking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when he
released something. Every time Quinn would hit his shadow, his MC
points would go down by a chunk or so. The same thing had happened
when he threw out the balls. The stronger the attack, it seemed the
more MC points would be used from the shadow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when Vorden was
about to attack one more time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, stop
Vorden!&quot; Quinn shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His shadow had
vanished, and he had run out of MC points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The shadow acted as
a type of shield; it wasn't solid enough to block attacks but would
be able to slow them down. Later, when Quinn's MC points were
restored a little bit, he did a few other tests. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Vorden was close
enough, he could use the shadow to grab onto him like an extra pair
of hands, or even grab on to his legs, slowing him down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But there wasn't
enough of the shadow to use it in both of these ways. He could simply
either use the shadow to attack or to defend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I can
see why your ability is a level 6 now.&quot; Vorden said, &quot;I
think it's more to do with how freely you can use the shadow and my
example would be the skills. Normally a skill would just be a
different type of attack but your ability, your shadows can actually
be used to do entirely new things. A separate storage space, masking
you in the night and even as a defensive shield. Its almost as if you
have three abilities combined into one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was happy with
the results of the shadow ability and hearing Vorden talk about made
him feel even more confident. He couldn't wait to unlock the other
skills in the Shadow Tab of his system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the spar over,
the two of them decided that once Quinn was fully rested and his MC
points were back, they would exit out of the training centre and go
exploring again. After all, if they did nothing, they would soon
start to starve, and Vorden didn't want another instance where Quinn
got to hungry. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It took around 30
seconds for Quinn to gain back a single MC point so it would take
around an hour for all of his points to be restored. Then they would
make their move back to the outside. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Outside, in the

buildings in the middle of the street. A specific area started to

little sparks of electricity were seen coming from it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The homeroom teacher
Del was here, although he was still wearing clothing like he was
ready to teach. Then there was the Doctor Hayley, she was dressed
more appropriately with high-end beast gear all over. She didn't look

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When entering the
portal, as long as there was one on the other end, it would throw you
somewhere within a one-mile radius of another. As long as there was
already a portal set up on the other end. The reason why the group
were holding hands is to ensure that they would all be teleported to
the same place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unlike when Quinn
and Vorden entered the teleporter one by one, they were chucked to
different locations. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On Del's back was a
fairly large rucksack that looked quite heavy. As he walked with the
group, hit footsteps stomped the ground and his back was arched. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why do I have
to carry this thing!&quot; Del complained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Right now
you're the weakest of us four right?&quot; Fay replied, &quot;So if
you want us to protect you, it's best that you carry the portable
teleporter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del then looked at
Hayley who was by his side, and even he had to admit she looked quite
frightening for a doctor. She was in a full set of large beast gear.
A frightening-looking chest piece that looked to have a face on it
and spikes sticking out of the shoulder pads. On her back, she was
carrying a large single greatsword that was nearly the same size as
herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She almost looked
like a professional Traveller that went hunting in these types of
places all the time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Rich people, that's
what happens when your father is a general in the army.' Del thought.
</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, I
understand that but why even the need to bring the portable
teleporter in the first place? Isn't the teleporter fine on this
end?&quot; Del asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's back up.&quot;
Leo said, &quot;Look around you and look at this shelter. It was
basically the size of a city, don't you think they had people
protecting it as strong as us. We might encounter a strong beast and
have to make an emergency exit, or there might even be beast blocking
the current portal. It's always better to be safe than sorry.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay with that
said and done let's head for the training centre. It was the place
the portal was last known to be, and we can see if it's safe or not.
Leo will lead the way for us. I don't want to stay on this planet for
long, and I don't want to find out what destroyed this shelter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo walked upfront
and using his ability, the group were able to avoid trouble. In a
way, although blind, his sight was better than the others. His
ability allowed him to see an aura around things and see them in
different colours. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A beasts aura was
always red, while humans yellow. It also allowed him to see the aura
through most objects such as building walls and so on. Allowing them
to avoid any confrontation with beasts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, if the
group saw only a few Rattaclaw that they could deal with, instead of
taking the long route round. Leo and Fay would often head out and
deal with them quickly. The two of them were both swordsmen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Fay would use
her longsword, Leo would use his katana blade. Not even giving the
rats a chance to live. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they continued to
walk, Hayley had a question on her mind after seeing the two of them
deal with the rats. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I always
wondered, which of you two are stronger?&quot; Hayley asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two upfront
suddenly froze, and Del looked at Hayley like she had no sense of
personal questions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, you can't
just ask something like that?&quot; Del whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, he was
interested. Everyone was. These types of questions came up all the
time. Fay and Leo were both of the same ranks. Two of the 8 sergeants
at the school. Talk always happened between the other teachers and
soldiers about who was the strongest out of them all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This also happened
regularly with the three generals. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay,&quot;
Fay said. &quot;I can easily answer for you. It's Leo. I don't know
if you two know this, but we had to practically beg him to join our
ranks after the first war. Back then, he was only a private, but he
had made so many accomplishments; it was unbelievable. He had one
condition when joining the army. I would like to become a teacher.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo didn't say
anything after that, in fact, he never spoke much in the first place,
but Del was still wondering how it was possible. Leo's ability was
handy sure, and it might be a high-level ability. But that was only
because it required a high amount of MC to use. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not because it was
powerful. While Fay had the ability of super speed. If the two of
them fought, there was no way he could see her losing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Del
thought she must have just said that to be kind to her senior. Fay
was still quite young, after all. Only in her late twenties. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the group
had arrived just outside the training centre. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We'll make
sure the portal is safe first and then after we will go out looking
for the kids,&quot; Fay said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The entrance
looks clear.&quot; Said Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They walked onward
and eventually saw the dead Rattaclaws just outside of the entrance.
Not only that but the entrance to the place was completely busted. It
had been bent, and miss mangled but was still covering the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay went to the

that it was unlocked, but the doors wouldn't move. They were too
damaged. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What happened
here?&quot; Hayley asked, &quot;Do you think it was the kids?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think you

remember?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah, Vorden the
original correct, his ability is to copy that of others. Although we
don't really know how it works, it could be possible. If he copied a
strong ability, then I could see him being able to kill these Rats.&quot;
Said Fay. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well if we

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you

Leo asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The mission

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When I joined

risking my life for the sake of everyone. For the sake of the human

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Enough you

you are passionate about this. We will scout the nearby area using
your ability. If we find nothing, then we leave. Fair?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo didn't say much
and started to walk up to the door, he drew out his katana blade and

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Isn't that

to make. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo slashed the door
with one swing. No sound was made, and it seemed like the door wasn't

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After entering
through the Glathrium door, the group then went to lift the fallen
part of the door up and place it back up. It was heavy, but with
Hayley's help, the door felt extremely light, and they managed to set
it perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While it might not
keep the beast out at least, it would deter them from entering. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Del watching the
whole thing hated to think just how high a level of beast equipment
Hayley was wearing to be able to lift the door so easily. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They continued to
walk in the hallway which was covered in darkness, although for Leo
leading the way it made no difference. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But while walking,
Del couldn't get out of his head how easily Leo was able to break the
door. It wasn't like Del was a student he was a professor too. He had
participated in the war back then as well and never saw anything like
what he saw today. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Could it be a demon
level weapon?' He thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he quickly came
to the conclusion that it was impossible. At the moment, there were
only two demon level beast weapons in existence. One of them belonged
to the Army, while the other belonged to the group known as Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, it was
clear to Del that what Leo was using was at least a top-level Beast
tier weapon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had entered the
reception area, where several doorways were leading to different
sections of the training centre. At the front, there was the
reception desk with two hallways leading to the arena. Then there was
the actual reception room which could also lead you to the canteen
and the living quarters. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, stop,&quot;
Hayley said to Leo and Fay upfront. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She bent down and
studied the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can you see
what this is? It's blood and leading that way.&quot; She said as she
pointed to the living quarters. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How can you
tell which direction, it's coming from the stadium as well?&quot; Del
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, the
blood tail, you can see that it's heading in this direction and
there's a lot of it, almost as if someone was dragged this way.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, let's
hurry, it could be one of the students,&quot; Fay said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They made sure not
to rush but quickly headed in the direction of the blood following
the trail. If there was a beast inside, they needed to make sure they
wouldn't startle it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo also no longer
took the lead, and instead, it was Fay. Usually, Leo's ability would
allow him to detect auras and abilities through wall's and such, but
it didn't work through Glathrium, and the whole place was made of it.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although he could
still direct himself, he couldn't tell if there was danger up ahead
until actually seeing it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They followed the
trail until finally, it led them to the hallway, with a broken door
outside and a ripped apart chair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay peaked her head
into the room with the broken door and immediately turned away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hayley I think
you better take a look at this,&quot; Fay said, turning her head
away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley took over and
went inside the room, while Del also took a look and turned his head
away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you see
the body?&quot; Del said, &quot;its body was ripped in half, guts
spilling everywhere.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo, who was
standing next to him, turned his head and looked him in the eye. &quot;No
I didn't see anything, I haven't done so in a while now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley continued to
examine the body, she went around the man's neck. Underneath his
beast armour, she pulled out a coloured dog tag. While holding the
dog tag, she continued to inspect the body, and that's when she
spotted something. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Again, two bite
marks on the neck, just like the other students.' Hayley thought. 'Is
there really a beast inside the academy somewhere, the same thing
that killed this man? Or is it something else?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley then stood up
from the body and walked forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you want
the good news or bad news?&quot; She said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just tell us
everything,&quot; Fay replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, the good
news is it's not one of the students.&quot; Hayley then pulled out
the tag which was attached to a chain and dangled it in front of the
others. &quot;The bad news is he was from one of the big four
families.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each person's face
dropped as soon as they heard the news. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The tag says
Truedream.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay immediately
slammed her fist, against the wall as she heard those words. &quot;Why
them out of all the families.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The big four
families were the ones who had the power to rival the military. They
were originals with immense power who chose not to share their
abilities. However, the Truedream family were the most unique out of
the four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had the closest
connection with the military, enough to even have a seat at the
council table. This was all because of the head of the family, who
had the ability to steal others abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If anyone ever tried
to rebel against the Army, then they would get a visit from the
Truedream leader, and they could never use their ability again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only problem was
Truedream could only take away their abilities but not use them. So
he needed a strong ally, and that's why he got close to the military.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when he felt
safe and protected, he started to gather his own men, the abilities
he had taken, he would gift to those he trusted, and they were truly
grateful to him. But there was always this fear in the back of his
mind he could be betrayed by his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no powers for
himself, he chose to stay by the military side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This fear kept
people in line, this fear was what made people complacent with the
system the military had today. Although many didn't agree with the
cruel ways and the carrot and stick approach, the current army had.
They had no choice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We can leave
him here for now, but it's best before we leave, we bring his body
and take it to the Truedream family.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a pain,
but they should be thankful we brought back one of their own,&quot;
Fay said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After leaving the
body be, they decided to follow the trail of blood back outside and
into the stadium, and that's when they spotted the two kids lying
down on the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;They're here,
what luck!&quot; Del said as he ran forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley, Fay and Del
immediately went forward while Leo was the only one who stayed back.
For in the centre of the arena he could see a colour of aura he had
never seen before, one which was purple. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the rescue
team had arrived. Vorden and Quinn were both sitting down in the
centre of the arena. The two of them didn't have much to talk about,
so they just chatted about there old lives at school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's life seemed
horrible, he went on to explain how he was raised with no parents and
how he was bullied since entering school. The bullying wasn't really
bad until the treaty was signed. When there was no more war, that's
when people started to go crazy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, whenever
Quinn would ask Vorden about his school life, he would give a simple
answer and ask Quinn a question. The first few times, he didn't
really notice anything strange, but then, Quinn started purposely
asking questions that were harder to avoid. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But again, Vorden
seemed to avoid the question, in the end, Quinn decided to stop. It
wasn't right integrating someone like this. If Vorden had something
he didn't want to share, then it was up to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, I just
noticed something,&quot; Vorden said as he pointed at Quinn's wrist. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn lifted his
hand and looked at it, and even he was surprised by what he was
seeing. The number on his wristwatch was still saying he was a level
1. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought you
said it would change when I activated my MC points?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, that's
what's supposed to happen.&quot; Vorden then placed his hand on his
chin as he thought about it for a while. &quot;Do you think it's
because you're a vampire? Just like how I can't copy your shadow
ability, the watch might not be able to measure your type of MC in
your body.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this news,
Quinn was actually a little upset. With the use and gain of an
ability as well as Vorden's plan. He was looking forward to being
able to use his powers freely. As a level 6 user people would no
longer challenge him just as he walked around the school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now, if he
showed he had shadow powers and the number on his wristwatch still
indicated one, they would be just as suspicious about him. They would
say the watch was broken and get him a new one, but it would just be

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think it's
best if you hide your shadow ability for now.&quot; Said Vorden.
&quot;You've already hidden your vampire abilities for this long, you
can hide your shadow abilities, right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden could see
Quinn was a little downhearted by the news he had given him. After
learning what Quinn had gone through at his last school, it was
understandable. In a way, Vorden thought he was helping him by
getting revenge and attacking those second years, but it was just
making him and Peter a bigger target. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't look so
down,&quot; said Vorden. &quot;if we find someone in the school
that's good at technology, we can get them to tinker with the watch.
They don't need to find out about your cells but just get someone to
hack it, so it displays the number six. Plus look at the Brightside,
the military tournament is coming up, and it would be good if you
hide your ability until then. Show everyone on the big stage. Besides
if you came back with a level 6 now, they would be more shocked about
how you learnt it so fast, so it works in our favour.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing those words
did cheer Quinn up a bit. There was always a geeky person who was
good at technology in the school. The only problem was approaching
said person. Maybe this was something Layla would be better at doing.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the truth was,
Del, didn't care about either of them at all. He was filled with
tears of joy that they wouldn't have to stay in this scary place any
longer. He felt like the longer he remained in this place, the more
likely he was to die, especially after seeing Ian's dead body on the
floor. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't like what

defeated at this point, he didn't care what happened to him. What

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Outside somewhere in
the world, there was a city named Dreamland. The place was condensed
packed with buildings and skyscrapers everywhere, and there didn't
seem to be a place of open land that could be seen. A large wall also
stood surrounding it around a hundred meters high. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On top of the walls,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Security was a

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was what caused
the Humans to create shelters on other planets. It was a lot cheaper

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once students had
left the academy, they were able to become Travellers and either work
for a Faction, Family or as a freelancer. The world government issued
these travellers with a Rank depending on the difficulty of tasks
they can complete. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At some point, power
levels didn't matter too much on the outside. The attribute that
high-level beast gear gave you was much more useful. It was more
important how you used your ability in conjunction with the beast
gear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When starting out as
a traveller, everyone started as a rank F. The more tasks you would
complete the more points you would be awarded. Usually, it would take
a couple years between each Rank to level up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because of the way

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Therefore,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack sat there and
thought about it for a while. It was usual for him to get reports
from other families and organisations when they found the dead bodies

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What troubled him,
though, was the person who had actually died. To give a person an
ability that he had taken away, he had to touch them and meet them in
person. The low-level abilities he usually didn't remember too much. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
