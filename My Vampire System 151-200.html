<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing alone in
the fantasy section of the library was Erin and a strange boy known
as Fex. Erin was still holding a Vampire love story in her hand, and
her face had gone bright red as she couldn't believe someone had just
caught her reading such a dirty book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'How could they
describe such intimate scenes in such a strange way? Although, the
boy in front of me seemed to have some idea of what the book was.
Could it be that the boy was interested in the same type of things?'
She thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quickly hoping to
avoid further embarrassment, Erin put the book back where it was
placed and started to walk over towards the boy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Fex saw her
walking towards him, he started to lick his lips. 'What a tasty
looking person,' Fex thought. 'Looks like most of the human minds in
this school are pretty weak.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin continued to
walk forward with her head down, and when she was finally close
enough, she halted her steps. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, why don't
you lift your head, so I can take another look at your pretty face?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin lifted her
head, but dashed forward in an instant, a type of ice sword was
forming in her right hand. Using her forearm, she pushed Fex up
against the wall right by his neck. The area started to freeze and
now an ice sword was pointed right at his throat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you tell
anyone about what you saw today, you're dead, you hear me?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's with
this girl, how can you just attack someone like that?&quot; Fex
cried. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin proceeded to
slowly freeze both of his hands to the wall as well as made sure that
he couldn't retaliate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Gradually, the ice
from Erin's forearm was starting to spread and was freezing Fex' neck
as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, I don't
want to cause any trouble.&quot; He said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin looked at him
carefully, noticing all the features that he had. &quot;Good, I will
remember you, and if anyone finds out about what you saw today, I'll
be coming back for you,&quot; Erin said as she took away the ice
sword. She then started her exit, leaving Fex in this sticky
situation, frozen to the wall with the ice still confining his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot; He
shouted, &quot;Aren't you going to let me go?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin continued to
walk off towards the centre of the library. Without turning back, she
said, &quot;It's just a little reminder of what can happen if you
don't listen.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, Erin had
left the library. The other people who were nearby went to look at
the commotion down the aisle, wondering what was going on. However,
all they could see was a single man stuck up against the wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few laughed and
giggled as it wasn't the first time they had seen something like
this. After all, few of the braver boys among the first-year students
had tried to confess their &quot;love&quot; to Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But she hated it
when people would waste her time. They would always ask to meet in a
quiet or a secret place, and Erin would always think that it was for
a matter of importance to her, yet it was the same every time. They
would confess their &quot;love&quot; for Erin and ask her out on a
date, the usual reply she would give was to stick these, in their own
eyes, love interests to the wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She would often
leave them there frozen in place while waiting for the ice to melt.
She did this as a warning for other suitors in the future. Slowly,
people started to get the message and stopped approaching her, so it
had been a while since the other students had seen such a thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After having a
giggle, most of the students continued with what they were doing,
going back to reading books or chatting away in the library. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then while no one
was looking, Fex used his strength and to break free both of his arms
from the ice. He then used his hands to crack the ice that was around
his neck as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like
someone was able to resist my charm already?&quot; Fex said. &quot;Well,
now that just makes me want to go after her more. I will remember you
ice girl. Perhaps this place won't be so bad after all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex's original plan
was to travel and explore the human world. To experience all the
things his grandpa had told him, but his plans were quickly stopped
once he was caught. When he woke up, he was in front of General
Nathan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had explained
to him what had happened and why he was brought there - How he had
become a suspect of draft evasion. However, Nathan did say that as
long as he contacts his guardians, inform them, and show proof of his
age, they would let him go free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But this was not an
option for Fex. He was a lot more scared of his father and the others
then he was off the humans. If he was to be found right now, he
couldn't imagine the horrible things that his father would do to him.
Besides, this was his only chance to experience what life was like,
as a human. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex thought all
things were going well, Nathan had asked a question which was
difficult for him to answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, since
you claim to no longer have any parents or such, there is just one
thing I need you to do. Fill out this form for me, and we will get
you starting your lessons as soon as possible.&quot; Nathan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A digital display
then appeared in front of Fex's face with a little digital keyboard.
It asked for basic details such as name and date of birth. For both
of these things, Fex didn't use his real information, but then, there
was one more question that was asked that caused him to pause. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It asked him what
type of ability he had. For this question, he had a plan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After checking over
the details and seeing Fex's ability, there was no more work that
needed to be done. A wristwatch was given to Fex before leaving. The
display on the device was showing a number 1. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After seeing this,
Nathan no longer had any interest in him. He would leave the scouting
job to Duke, to entice him with higher-level ability books. The whole
method Duke used didn't really sit well with Nathan, but he knew the
base had a quota to hit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not knowing what to
do, and knowing nearly no one at the base, Fex decided to head to the
library to update himself on current events. Although, after entering
the library, he soon got distracted, he was wondering what the people
of Earth had thought about vampires. He wondered if they even had any
new information on them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This led him to his
first real encounter with another student, Erin, the rest of the
story was what got him frozen to a wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After looking at a
few books about Vampires, he quickly realized that most of it was
just a bunch of nonsense. They hadn't learnt much about how vampires
actually operated, which meant Fex had to be even more careful not to
reveal their secrets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Fex was leaving
the library, he had no idea what to do, he decided that he would just
have to go to his dorm room. While walking down the hallway towards
the staircase, a student ran past him. As this student passed him, he
caught a whiff of scent with his nose and a familiar smell registered
in his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It took him a while
to figure out what this smell was, but when he recognized it, he
realized it was very familiar to him, it was the smell of another
vampire. However, he had realized this too late, when he turned his
head, the student who had run past was already gone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now this is
interesting, I wonder what family he belongs to. What on earth is he
doing at this base?&quot; Fex thought </FONT></FONT>

away from the prying eyes of others, the two of them stood there in
shock as they watched Peter feasting on a human body. Even though
they were now only a few feet away from them, Peter continued to rip

Layla said as she quickly rushed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla seemed to be
experiencing more and more gruesome things lately. When she saw that
head the Dalki threw at them, she didn't really have time to take it
in before the fear of being killed herself took over. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But this was
different; she was able to fully take in the sight of Peter eating
another person in front of her. Seeing what Peter was doing, suddenly
she was starting to get second ideas about Quinn turning her into a
vampire. Was it something she could really handle? The books made it
seem so much easier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter!&quot;
Vorden said in an aggressive but quiet voice, &quot;Peter!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Peter
seemed to snap out of whatever daze he was in. He looked at the body
on the floor and in his hand was a piece of reddish-pink flesh. He
had no idea which part of the body it had come from. He immediately
dropped what was in his hand and started to scurry away backwards
into the alley. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Was this me?&quot;
Peter said as he thought back to what had happened just moments ago. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Earl had called
out to him and had kicked him down the alley a type of rage had
consumed him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter stood there
looking at Earl's face all the memories of what had been done to him
started to surface once again. Everything that happened to him, just
because he was weak. Well, Peter wasn't weak anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Earl readied his arm
and went in for another slap to the face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter grabbed it
mid-air and using all his strength crushed Earl's fingers. As Earl
yelled in pain the image Peter had earlier came true, making his hand
into a claw like shape and using all the supernatural strength he
had, he clawed towards Earl's neck ripping out the jugular in one go.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then soon after,
Earl had become a tasty snack for Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter would have
liked to say his mind was out of it, he didn't know what he was
doing, but he knew that was all a lie. For every step of the way
Peter knew exactly what he was doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second Earl had
hit him he knew what he had planned to do. For once he could get his
sweet revenge, all the people that betrayed him, he would get rid of.
They weren't needed in human society anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing Peter
didn't plan for was what happened after. When seeing Earl's body on
the floor, his eyes seemed to be attracted to something. It wasn't
the blood but what laid beneath it. The pink line of muscle fibre and
fatty cells. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before he knew it he
was digging in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, in front
of Vorden, Peter needed to keep up his act, as a weak minded boy. He
was too worried what the others would think of him, if they found out
he knew exactly what he had just done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I….I… Just
killed someone.&quot; Peter said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Cut the crap,&quot;
Vorden said.&quot; Now is not the time to act like this, how long has
he been dead for?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Peter replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I said how
long, it's important Peter. Five minutes, ten minutes?&quot; The
panic in Vorden's voice seemed to be getting urgent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know,
maybe ten minutes I would say.&quot; Peter answered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then rushed
over to the body, if you could still call it that, as it was now
complete ripped up into little pieces. It was hard to recognise what
was what, apart from the main body parts, but then Vorden found what
he was looking for. The wrist watch. Using his powers he lifted the
watch into the air before throwing it in a random direction as far as
he could. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Wasting no time he
then grabbed Peter by the arm and dragged him out of the alley. &quot;We
have to get out of here now.&quot; He said with urgency in his voice.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two were
running they quickly saw Layla and she too could see Peter with blood
all over his uniform. &quot;What's happening?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have to go,
now!&quot; Vorden shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She didn't ask any
more questions and the three of them quickly ran away from the second
year building. Once they were out of there, they quickly headed
towards the park where they were before, but they weren't rushing
this time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden stayed in
front going out from time to time while asking the other two to stay
back. When the area was clear they would walk again until they
finally returned to the open spot in the forest where they were
practising a while ago. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Take off your
clothes now.&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, but then
everyone will see me naked.&quot; Peter replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then walked
over to Peter and started ripping the clothes off him, by now he had
lost his patience with Peter. He knew something like this would
happen sooner or later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Get off!&quot;
Peter said. &quot;I can do it myself.&quot; Using both of his hands
he shoved Vorden with quite some strength but Vorden stayed on his
feet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Taking a step back
Vorden then allowed Peter to take off his own clothes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was the
big rush back there, we just left the body in the alleyway, won't the
school find out that a student died?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We had no
choice,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;Maybe if we had gotten there a
little earlier we could have done something, taken the body with us.
But once the watch is taken off of or detects no sign of life it
pings a message to the school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fortunately
for us the watch waits a full five minutes before sending this type
of thing, that's why I was in a rush. If we were seen there's nothing
we can do. At least now we won't be caught.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But what about
the body, won't they search for whoever did this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Layla said
this, the sound of leaves ruffling on the floor could be heard as
another person entered this part of the forest. It was a student
holding an umbrella in his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the strange
feeling that had come over Quinn's body had disappeared. A message
appeared, one stating that a family member of his had gotten
stronger. There was no need to ask the system what the message meant
because he could feel it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The strange
sensation and connection between him and Peter. It was a similar
feeling to when he consumed blood but it wasn't him getting stronger
it was Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry
Logan. Thanks for all your help, but I don't have time to talk now, I
have got to go!&quot; Quinn shouted. He went up to the mannequin that
contained the mask and the suit and immediately put them into his
dimensional void and just like with his other beast equipment, they
had been registered with his shadow equip so he was able to put the
costume on and off whenever he wanted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Quinn was
about to leave though the door, he turned and looked at the
workbench. On top there were several different mask designs all a
little different form each other. They were the different designs he
and Logan had come up with until they felt like one of them was best.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Logan if
it's not too much trouble, do you think you could complete the other
mask designs for me?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan chuckled to
himself. &quot;Are you kidding me? I could finish them all by the end
of today if I wanted to.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn smiled back
and looked at the bags under his eyes he could tell that Logan had
worked hard on the costume and hadn't even rested since finishing it.
&quot;Logan, I promise I'll pay you back for all this one day. As
soon as I find out anything about this situation, I'll let you know.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, Quinn ran
down the hallway and down the staircase rushing over to where Peter
was. Although he had no clue where Layla and Vorden had taken him. It
felt like the system or a part inside of him was telling him where
Peter was. If he went towards the right direction the connection grew
stronger. If he headed in the wrong direction it felt weaker. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was similar to
playing a game of hot and cold. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without slowing
down, Quin ran down the stairs and out the hallway ignoring everyone
he went past. But for the first time a strange scent entered his
nose. It was unusual for Quinn as he had never smelt this before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ever since he had
turned into a vampire all of his senses seemed to improve apart from
his taste but he could also say it was just heightened in other
areas. Still, this smell was completely different to everyone else
around him and he didn't know why. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he wasn't in such
a rush and panic he would have turned around to see just who was
giving off such a strange smell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving the
school he grabbed a random umbrella at the entrance. Often people
would forget their umbrellas after a day of rain leaving it out to
dry, this made things a lot easier for Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once he had left the
academy, he continued to listen to his body following the connection
which eventually led him to the park and finally inside the forest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he arrived he
managed to hear the last few words that Layla had said. However there
wasn't much to ask, judging by the systems message Quinn could guess
what had already happened. And seeing the bloody clothes in Vorden's
hands and the marks of dried blood on Peter's hands and mouth he
already knew. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had eaten
human flesh and most likely killed someone in the process. While
Quinn wanted to blame Peter for his actions he really couldn't. Quinn
was the one who turned him into this creature, and he knew exactly
what it was like. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn had
turned into a vampire, he too was unable to control his lust for
blood and ended up biting Layla in the process. It was just
unfortunate that for Peter his needs were human flesh, which usually
turns out fatal for the person being eaten. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden was
exiting the forest from where Quinn had gone he whispered into
Quinn's ear. &quot;You need to do something about him and fast.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as he said
those words, he continued to exit the forest with the clothes in his
hands while shouting. &quot;I'll get rid of these; you guys look
after Peter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now can one of
you please tell me what happened?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile Vorden
made sure to cover the clothes as best as he could. When wrapped and
piled in a bundle it was easy to cover most of the blood marks. He
entered the school without being seen, and headed back to the dorm
room where he put all of the bloody clothes into a plastic bag
including his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then from his and
Peter's closets he grabbed a change of clothing. Luckily the school
supplied them with plenty of uniforms, mainly because of how much
fighting went on at the school. Although if you went through too many
you would eventually have to pay for it yourself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

successfully copied his flame abilities. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh Vorden,&quot;

you, ermm about those crystals, you don't have to worry about giving
them back. Think of it as a gift form my family to yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Several soldiers
were standing outside the second year building, they were blocking
all the entrances both at the front and backside of the building.
During the investigation, all the second-year students were ordered
to gather outside on the field in front of the second-year building.
A lot of rumours were going around in the crowd of students, they
were all wondering what was going on. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second-year
teachers started the investigation because they were the first on the
scene, when they discovered that it was actually a first-year student
who had died, they called in the first-year teacher and handed over
the investigation to them. At the back of the building, in the alley,
Fay and Hayley were currently investigating the scene together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking around the
gruesome scene of the murder, Hayley and Fay were reminded of things
they had seen on the battlefield during the war, that's how bad it
looked to them. Because they were both war veterans they had become
immune to this kind of blood and gore, as Hayley was kneeling on the
floor and examining body parts, she seemed to be unaffected by the
whole thing, she was picking up bloody bones and bits of flesh like
she was checking out some clothes in a fashion store. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After she had looked
around for a while it seemed like she had spotted something
interesting, she started to pick up body parts one by one and placed
them in a specific order, some of them she lined up in a row so she
could examine them in more detail. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at what

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I noticed
something strange about all the parts I've gathered and lined up,
they all have one thing in common,&quot; Hayley replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As far as I
can see the only thing they have in common is that they are spattered
with blood all over. So what did you notice? Do you think it was some
type of beast that came through a portal, or maybe it is a student
with an unusual ability?&quot; Fay asked as she looked around, she
was trying to see what Hayley had noticed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley picked up one
of the body parts which looked like part of a leg, she then showed it
to Fay and said, &quot;You see this here?&quot; while she pointed at
two puncture marks. &quot;For the most part it looks like who or
whatever did this used some type of claw to dig into this student's
flesh, but on some body parts I noticed those puncture wounds that
look like teeth marks.&quot; Hayley continued, &quot;Sometimes the
flesh is ripped from the body in whole chunks, but sometimes it looks
like something chewed on it.&quot; In a soft voice, she whispered to
herself, &quot;It probably wasn't to taste the blood.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, I see
what you're saying,&quot; Fay said with confusion on her face. &quot;But
doesn't that only confirm our theory that it was a beast that did
this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, the
thing is, this isn't the first time that I've seen these kinds of
marks. Do you remember when we went through the red portal and we
discovered the true dream member?&quot; Hayley asked. &quot;Well, he
wasn't the only one, I've seen the same marks on other students in
the sickbay before.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're not
saying those two students could have anything to do with it, are
you?&quot; Fay asked incredulously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not saying
that they are the culprit, but whatever it is, it's clearly following
them around, or linked to them in some way.&quot; Hayley replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Once this
investigation is over, it looks like we will have to call the two of
them in for some more questioning.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once Vorden had
returned to the park, he also explained what had happened on the way
there, such as how the news had already spread and regarding the
investigation of the scene. After cleaning Peter up with a few
bottles of water, and changing his clothes, they all went back to the
dorm room together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the first
year building dorm room, the group had gathered. Vorden, Peter, Quinn
were all sitting down, Layla, on the other hand, couldn't stop pacing
around and was nervously fidgeting with her hair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it!&quot;
Layla shouted. &quot;Now that I've witnessed everything, I'll be
called an accomplice. If they find out about this, we could be put in
the dungeon. What will I tell my parents then?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the first
time the group had seen Layla so freaked out. Although she tended to
overreact to things at times, it never seemed like she couldn't deal
with the situation, however this time she was very worried and
agitated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, I think
you owe us an explanation,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;Fair enough, if
you were hungry and needed to eat something, but why didn't you come
to us? You knew we were waiting for you outside. This is the second
time that you've done something like this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry, I
don't know what came over me,&quot; Peter said. &quot;When the hunger
grew and Earl slapped me, I just lost control. When I finally
regained control, I was already eating his corpse, I don't know what
happened in between.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter turned out to
be quite an impressive actor. He looked frightened and worried, and
everyone there bought it, even Vorden believed him in the end, even
though he was unsure at first. Although, there was one exception. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's lying.&quot;

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Remember how I
said that he would be required to eat human flesh. The worst-case
scenario would be him losing control tomorrow. Even then the process
would have been slower than this. He would have gotten hunger pangs
first, and later he would slowly become unstable. You would have also
felt the connection between the two of you grow weaker as he got more
hungry. If you want to find out the truth, here is my advice, this is
what you need to do….&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then stepped
forward, in front of the others, with a serious look on his face as
he confronted Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You need to
tell me the truth, Peter. Why did you kill him?&quot; As Quinn asked
this question, he bit down on his thumb using his fang. He then
lifted his hand, and like some type of magnet, Peter was attracted to
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter immediately
leapt up from where he was and started to suck on Quinn's thumb,
absorbing the blood into his body. The connection between the two
started to grow stronger again, and both of their eyes started to
glow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stop, stand
back!&quot; Quinn said in an authoritative voice, making Peter do as
he was told and stand back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now tell me,
why did you kill that student?&quot; Quinn again used that
authoritative voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter's eyes lit up
red and he felt like an urge to answer truthfully. It was like a
magic truth spell, it forced Peter to be truthful with his master. He
immediately started telling Quinn the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Earl, if it
was anyone that deserved to die, it was him. Any day, whenever I was
on my own and when your backs were turned from me, he would come to
torture me. If I didn't obey, he would snap my fingers. Then, they
had a healer come by and heal it again, proceeding to repeat the
process of torturing me.&quot; Peter articulated his reasoning,
sighing before continuing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He saw me as an easy
target. If I wanted to get away from the pain, I had no choice but to
follow his orders. After I met with Duke I got rewarded with the
ability books, but he didn't get anything from Duke, so he wanted to
take his anger out on me. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He took me to that
alley with a plan to beat me, just to satisfy his own need to be in
control. But this time I finally had the power to fight back, so I
decided to show him he can't mess with me anymore, he had it coming
and he deserved everything he got. Eating him was just a little
bonus, and I might have overdone it a bit.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing the truth
come out of Peter's mouth made Quinn feel a lot better. If he had
done it for pleasure, or because his mind had been overcome with the
hunger for human flesh, it would have made Quinn truly fearful.
However, Peter had a good reason, even though it was a bit extreme. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the moment, the
way the school and the whole world worked, anyone who suddenly rose
in power drastically would stand up and retaliate to their
suppressors. It was just the way the system worked. Of course, this
didn't happen very often, because most people didn't have a way to
grow in power faster than their oppressors, not like Quinn and Peter
anyhow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter your
actions aren't wrong, and if I was in your shoes I would have done
the same thing,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;But here is where you and I
are different. Your actions also put Quinn in danger. If you're
caught, there is always a chance that it could lead back to him. And
what's even more, we are involved as well.&quot; Vorden glared at
Peter before continuing, &quot;I plan to take my revenge on Duke and
Momo in our second year, but when I do I will do it carefully, so no
one else gets hurt.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden said
this, he was also talking about himself. What happened to Peter made
him feel like it was a reflection of his own actions. It was only
because Vorden chose to hang out with them, which upset the order of
things at the school, and then started to target the second years,
that Duke seemed to have it out for him. And to get close to Vorden,
he targeted his friends first. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the reason
why he couldn't completely blame Peter for his actions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With everything out
in the open, there was no more use talking about it. It was best if
they never spoke of what happened again, but all of them knew that it
would have to be brought up soon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System, is
there any way for Peter to stop consuming meat? Any way at all?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course
there is, but you're not going to like the answer I'm about to give
you.&quot; The system said. &quot;Just like yourself when you consume
blood, you grow stronger, the same goes for Peter when he eats human
flesh. Although for him there is a limit. Eventually, he will grow so

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day
everything was back to normal, as if nothing had happened, they had
at least expected something to come from all of this. Of course the
students still gossiped about the events that happened behind the
second year building, but because nobody really knew what happened
that's all it was, rumours. The scene of the murder had been cleaned
up quickly after the investigation had finished, and the second year
students were allowed to enter their building again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The rumours kept
spreading between the students, one story was wilder than the next,
so eventually the Generals decided to send out a general announcement
to update all the students about the situation. They did this to
avoid that rumours would turn into panic. So all the students were
sent an emergency announcement through their wrist watch, everyone
got the same voice message. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The message said, &quot;A
beast has escaped through one of the portals, it has been tracked
down and it has been dealt with. A full investigation is underway to
find out how a beast was able to get through one of the portals on
its own, security around the portals has been increased to avoid the
same thing from reoccurring.&quot; This message was repeated several
times during that day, this gave all the students the time to listen
to it carefully.. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The day after the
announcement, the usual suspects had gathered together in the boy's
dorm room again, they were going to decide what to do with Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So do you feel
hungry right now?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not any more
than usual when I wake up.&quot; Peter replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden and Quinn had
already bought plenty of raw meat for him to eat, and for now it
seemed to be working in suppressing his hunger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The actual problem
was the system's words that worried Quinn the most. Now that Peter
had eaten human flesh, it would be very likely that the hunger and
craving for it would come back sooner. But because they didn't have a
baseline on how long Peter could go between meals of human flesh,
they didn't know when the next time he needed it would be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Peter had waited
with eating human flesh until had had gone crazy for it, the system
would have been able to make an estimate of the interval at which
Peter needed to feed on human meat again. But because Peter had
chosen to kill Earl on his own, and had then eaten parts of his body,
it was impossible to predict when he would go crazy and need to feed
on another human being. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This thought was on
the back of everyone's minds en Peter's, but Peter felt he had to
reassure the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Guys relax,&quot;
Peter said nervously. &quot;I won't be doing anything like that
again, and Quinn can testify to it that I'm not lying. I promise, as
soon as I get hungry again, I'll let you guys know straight away!&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Still,&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;That doesn't solve our problem of feeding you when
you do need to be fed. We may have gotten away with it this time but
we need something consistent.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other three
thought long and hard about what their options could be, but nobody
had come up with a good plan yet. Vorden did have a plan of sorts,
but it was definitely the 'last resort' type of plan. He still didn't
trust Peter yet, and he wanted to see how loyal he would be, only
after he was sure he could trust Peter, and all other options had
been thought of would he tell them his plan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Have you tried
drinking coffee?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How does
coffee help?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh... well...
never mind, I just read about it in a book once, don't mind me&quot;
Layla said smiling. &quot;Can't we get human flesh from the cemetery
or the morgue? The city has one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had actually
though of these suggestions himself, but unfortunately the system had
bad news for him again. The mean Peter could eat had to be very
fresh. To the point that it should be eaten off the bone of a living
person, or someone who had just died. Even after an hour the meat
would already be too old for Peter to consume. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another problem with
that plan was that people didn't just die in a military city like
that. It wasn't like a regular city which had high levels of crime,
or a population of elderly people. Also the consequences of getting
caught stealing a dead body from the morgue or cemetery wasn't
something they wanted to face. The only upside to it was that it's
better than getting caught killing another student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The pressure was
getting to Quinn... No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't come up
with a good way to get Peter some fresh human meat, he felt like
pulling his hair out in frustration. The only solution he could come
up with was killing people that deserved it, this way innocent people
wouldn't accidentally be attacked by Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was they
had to start making a list of people that deserved to be killed and
eaten, and this wasn't an easy thing to do. Even after Quinn became a
vampire, he still wasn't comfortable with randomly killing someone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden noticed that
Quinn was getting stressed out and he said, &quot;Quinn, relax. I
have an emergency backup plan, trust me, I'll handle it when it comes
to it. For now spend your day as normal as possible, to avoid looking
suspicious. Layla and I will try to come up with something, if that
doesn't work out we can use my backup plan.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What exactly
is the backup plan?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then started
at Layla and called Quinn over, he whispered something into his ear,
while he kept looking at Layla out of the corner of his eye. It was
clear to her that he was doing this to get one up on her. He had a
plan that would help Quinn and Peter out, and she didn't. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla couldn't help
but tap her foot and stare angrily at Peter who was in the corner of
the room. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden I can't
let you do that!&quot; Quinn shouted, with shock on his face. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Like I said,
it's a last resort, we will only do it if it comes down to it. It's
the only thing that we can do which won't put us in danger of getting
caught,&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Vorden had
helped Quinn through this process, what he was suggesting was just
too much. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden and
Layla were on babysitting duty for Peter, Quinn left to do his own
thing. Whatever happened he didn't want Vorden to go through with his
plan. The only other option he could think of was the hospital. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were plenty of
cases where soldiers would get injured in mock battles or out on
training expeditions to orange and red portal planets. Sometimes they
would even get lethally wounded. Sometimes they also caught a disease
of some sort. It was the only place in the city Quinn could think of
that both had fresh human meat and almost dead people. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now that Quinn
was outside, he decided to do some tests of for which he needed a
secluded spot and sunlight. He was back in the part at the open area
in the forest where the others had trained with Peter. The reason for
him being there was that he wanted to test if his new suit would
actually work. He closed the umbrella he was holding over his head
and threw it on the ground. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After verifying the
suit worked, Quinn also tried using his shadow and blood abilities to
see if they worked the same when he was wearing it. He first tested
his shadow abilities, and he hadn't noticed any difference when using
them compared to normal. Then he also tried out his blood abilities,
on a nearby tree, they weren't affected in strength or speed by the
suit either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He also tested if
the suit would restrict his movements in any way, but it turned out
not to be the case. Because it was made from light and flexible
material, it didn't hinder him in any way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After testing out
the suit, he was happy with the results. Logan had done him a huge
favour by helping him design and create it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He used shadow equip
again to put it in his shadow void, and decided to head to the
hospital to see if they could find a solution to their 'Peter'
problem there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For once he was
lucky, there was no problem entering the hospital. He could walk
around freely as a free citizen. Quinn headed to a specific room, but
as he was walking around, he noticed that the hospital had something
the school didn't. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In nearly every
corner of the rooms he had passed through, there were round objects
with a blinking red light, they were security cameras. There were no
cameras installed in the schools because of the pressure the
originals had put on the military, they were afraid that their
abilities would get copied or their techniques might get stolen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the city and its
buildings, this was different, students wouldn't be practising their
skills in the hospital, or anywhere else in the city, so there was no
reason why cameras couldn't be installed there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For Quinn, this was
a major problem. If he tried to take something from the hospital he
would be caught on camera doing it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was mentally
going over all his options, but he could use none of them right now.
If he used his suite, and someone noticed him putting it on, his
identity would be revealed. If he used shadow cloak he would be
invisible, but the objects he was carrying would still be visible, it
would look like they were floating through the air on their own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The cameras would
pick up a floating object, which would get reported. This, in turn,
would lead to another investigation. Still, it was an option. He
would keep it in mind for when they really needed it. But right now
it looked like Vorden's plan was the only viable option left. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that Quinn had
investigated the hospital as a solution to their problem, he decided
to head back. Of course, being a vampire he had noticed all the bags
of blood that were everywhere around him. 'Imagine having access to
all this blood, it would be an instant power increase,' he thought to
himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, it was only
something he could dream about. Maybe in the future when there was an
emergency that required him to get stronger quickly, he might
consider it, but only if the benefits outweighed the consequences of
getting caught. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn was about
to leave the hospital, a voice message appeared on his wristwatch. He
didn't even have an option to listen to it at a later time, because
it immediately started to play. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn Talen,
you are to report to General Nathan's office immediately. You have 30
minutes to comply. If you are not here within that timeframe, we will
send guards to come and escort you here immediately,&quot; the
message ended. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn couldn't help
but feel nervous had they found out about him being a vampire? Or
maybe they had found out about Peter, and he had ratted him out?! </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These thoughts had
made him considerer running away, but he immediately discarded that
option. It was impossible to escape from the military camp, and on
top of that, he would be reported as a draft evader. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because he was in
the city, he had to do his best to get to General Nathan's office in
time. He stood in front of the General's office door and knocked
before entering. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn entered
the room, he could see Nathan standing behind his desk, with Hayley
and Fay standing against the wall to one side. But this wasn't what
worried him, but it was a familiar woman sitting in front of Nathan's
desk. He had seen her before, and her ability was what worried him
because she could tell if someone was lying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please take a

the woman. </FONT></FONT>

room together. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm going out
for a bit, there is something I need to do in case we can't come up
with anything,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you mind

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving the
room he walked towards Layla, and he whispered the plan he had come
up with into her ear, then he immediately walked through the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing
Vorden's plans her eyes opened wide and her face dropped to the
floor. At that moment her whole opinion of Vorden had changed, in
fact, what he said was true. If it was her in his situation she was
unsure if she could do the same thing. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Vorden gone to

Peter and Layla alone in the room together. The two of them weren't
exactly the closest before, but the problem was the last time they

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had told Peter
off and even called him disappointing, but she saw him in a different

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some time had passed
and the two of them started doing the things they would usually do,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He thought about all
the pain he had suffered because of Earl, which had gone away just
like that. In an instant, Peter was able to get rid of him, and Peter

had done something good. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All Quinn could hope
for now was that they would ask him simple questions like last time.
If they just asked him if he was the one responsible for Earl's
death, then he could answer truthfully. It seemed like he had gotten
away with it the last time due to him only being a level one. They
never really considered him a suspect in the first place. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This was it!' Quinn
thought. They had asked a question, and in an instant, she would know
if he was lying or not. Her hands started to glow, and energy started
to enter Quinn through his hands, then a message from the system

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To his surprise, a
new message had appeared, unlike what happened last time. It was an
unexpected but welcome result. When the ability was used on him last
time, it had completely gone through. The only difference between now
and before was he had evolved into a full vampire, and obtained the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, it
depended on how her ability would react to him blocking it, Quinn was
unsure of this as well, it was a total gamble. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, he decided
there was nothing to lose right now, so his best option was to block
the ability and see how she would react. After confirming with the
system that he wished to block her ability, Quinn answered he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's telling
the truth.&quot; She said. The reason why she believed this, was
because of how her ability worked. It couldn't actually tell if
someone was telling the truth or if someone was lying. The ability
could actually only determine if someone was lying, when someone she
was touching was lying, she would feel a reaction from her ability,
but there was no reaction when someone was telling the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This meant if no

know was that Quinn was able to block her ability entirely,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The interrogation
went on after the girl touched Quinn's hands again, Nathan was asking
Quinn questions about the missing students from before, and
eventually this line of questioning lead to the bite marks. Quinn
answered the questions he could as truthfully as possible, but
whenever he wanted something to stay hidden, he would use the system
to block the girls ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, the

you were innocent, just like we thought.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, then why

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just to be
absolutely certain.&quot; Nathan replied. &quot;This time, we have
decided to be thorough, since there has now been more than one case,
and it seems that they are following the same pattern. Still, we can
now be sure that you are not the culprit, just like we expected.&quot;

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was then asked
to stand next to Fay and Hayley, to the side of the interrogation

had entered the room and saw Quinn and the others, he was trying his
best to figure out what was going on. Judging by the fact the head of
the first years, General Nathan, was here would suggest it was very
serious. However, Vorden couldn't make the link between him and
Quinn? How had he come to the conclusion the two of them were
involved in something. </FONT></FONT>

It was too much of a coincidence to see bite marks on multiple

now there number one suspect was the person who was with Quinn at the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden sat down in
the chair opposite the girl, while he was sitting, he would give the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now were just
here to ask you a few questions Vorden, simple right?&quot; Nathan
said with a smile. Usually Vorden was quite good at reading people,

it was nearly impossible for him to tell if it was genuine or not.
&quot;But I warn you to answer truthfully now, for our beautiful girl
here can tell when you are lying, or when you are telling the truth.&quot;

realized why Quinn was fidgeting about so much, and why he looked so
worried. They were clearly questioning Vorden about some type of
event, had they found out what he was and just wanted him to confirm
it, or did it have something to do with Peter. The problem was Vorden
himself didn't know how much information Quinn had revealed. </FONT></FONT>

her. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing that name
Vorden finally knew why they had called him. He didn't know why Quinn

him the abilities of the female in front of him. If her ability
worked similar to the lie detectors of the past, then as long as the

know the even, then it would still be seen as the truth. Although

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whenever Vorden
spoke to Sil. He would speak in a slow patient voice, like a mother
did when talking to their child. This was because Sil's mind was
quite childlike. One wrong word could set him off on a tantrum,
usually parents were stronger then their kids though and if this were
to happen they could control them. But in this case Sil was both
stronger then Raten and Vorden so they always had to speak to Sil om
a careful manner. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nathan then went to
adjust the glasses on his face, a habit of his when he was stressed
out. &quot;Maybe we really do have a beast roaming around the
school.&quot; Nathan then looked at the two of them, his gut feeling
was telling him something was wrong. But it was impossible, the
girl's ability was clearly telling them they were looking in the
wrong direction. </FONT></FONT>

the sergeants had left the room to try and gather more information.
The only ones left inside were them with Fay and the girl. Now that
the two of them were no longer under interrogation they were free to

over some documents with the girl while the two boys were sitting

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was
continuously pacing up and down as he saw Sil take control of the
seat in the black room. It was a rare occurrence. Sil usually came
out in times of danger and even then, once the danger was over, he
would return back to his dark corner. Yet for some reason, Sil seemed
to be slightly changing ever since Vorden had first met Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden liked the
change and thought Quinn would eventually be a good influence on him.
But now was not the time. They were in a tense situation and Quinn
had enough on his mind. Vorden could do nothing but stand there. He
was afraid if he was to approach Sil, he might freak out and remain
in control for the whole time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, are

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn did not know
how to react to this. He calmed down and started to think. How did
Vorden manage to escape the interrogation with the girl? Was it
something to do with his power? Or something entirely different?
Right now, Vorden was claiming to be a different person. If the
person before him didn't look exactly like Vorden, he would have
believed him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe it is an
ability he copied before coming here?&quot; Quinn thought. &quot;A

are a genius.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No problem at
all.&quot; Sil said. He lifted his hand and started rubbing Quinn's
curly hair, as if he was a cute dog. Quinn was starting to have odd
feelings about this. If it was just the two of them in a room, he
would have pulled away or even pushed Vorden, no Sil back. But they
were still under watch and he didn't want to cause a scene. &quot;If
you ever need any help, you can always call me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

said, &quot;Thank you, it looks like he won't become another Caser

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing that name
brought back bad memories for Vorden and Raten, but now was not the
time to think about it. Vorden quickly rushed over to the chair and
took control. To Vorden's side was Quinn, however, his hand was still
on top of Quinn's hair. His face went bright red as he pulled his
hand back. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That wasn't

we have nothing to worry about.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the words left
Quinn, he felt something fade away from his body. He was losing an
important part of himself, the connection with something was being
lost and he knew exactly what it was. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Grabbing his chest,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know. Guess
we are just unlucky. At this rate, if he doesn't get it every day, he
will continue to starve. And I'm afraid when he is hungry, I can't
control him like I did earlier.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

Quinn's words, his mind went back to the time before he came to
Nathan's office. When he entered the room, he remembered seeing Layla
pointing an arrow at Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't! What
if you go kill someone again? Come on, you can fight it. I have been
on diets ten times worse than this. Once I only drank juice with no

the hope of calming both Peter's nerves as well as her own. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would rather
it be someone who deserved it, than you.&quot; Peter said as he
looked up at her from the ground. &quot;You were the one who taught
me how much of a scumbag I was, but I'm different now.&quot; At that
moment, he felt as if someone was reaching down into his stomach with
their hand and were trying to pull all the food he just ate up and
onto the floor. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Out from behind the
teachers came a student. One that Quinn wasn't familiar with, however
Vorden knew him quite well. As soon as the student entered and looked
at the two of them he also noticed Vorden. The student was Berg
Sunshield. At the sight of Vorden his palms suddenly started to
sweat. After seeing him on planet Caladi. Berg had decided to try to
gather more information about him and his family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had informed his
family members that he had met up with one of the Blades. Immediately
their tone of voice had changed, and his father said to do whatever
he could to make sure the Blades wouldn't get upset with them. It was
a strange reaction. Although his father didn't carry a high rank in
his family he was still respected as a member of one of the big four.
It was the first time he had seen him act like this at the mention of
anyone's name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The even stranger
thing was, when Berg had tried to search information about the Blade
family he couldn't find anything. Nothing at all about what type of
ability they had, nothing about their contributions in the war. Even
when asking his friends, none of them seemed to have ever heard about
the Blade family. So it made the reaction his father had all the more
strange. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Soon enough though
his father's fear, became his fear, and the mystery behind Vorden
grew within his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now Berg here
said on the day of the event he saw a student running through the
halls looking quite panicked.&quot; Nathan said. &quot;Humans are
strange things you see and they love a little bit of gossip. While
everyone else was heading to the second year building to see what was
going on. A single student was running in the opposite direction.
Coincidentally though Berg's description seems to match one of you, a
curly black haired boy…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn remained
silent, there was no way they could convict him just for having a
suspicion. The problem was that they now had a witness, and because
they were suspicious of him they would probably keep a closer eye on
him from now on. This would only cause more problems in the future,
especially now he had Peter running wild in his ranks. He decided the
best thing to do for now was to just keep his mouth shut, if he said
anything it would be easy to slip up and make everything worse. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then started
to laugh by his side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You really
think Quinn did it?&quot; Vorden said. &quot;Come on, the two of them
don't even share the same classes, besides do you know how many curly
haired students with black hair there are in this school?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well you see
Vorden, that's why we brought him here, so he could confirm who he
saw that day.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That day Berg had
seen Quinn running through the halls. As soon as he entered the room
he recognized him but seeing Vorden defend him so suddenly like that
he knew something was up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This isn't the
kid I saw that day.&quot; Berg said. &quot;I'm pretty sure it was
someone else.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What!&quot;
Nathan said. &quot;Are you sure? Come closer and take another look.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Berg did as asked
and stepped closer and looked at Quinn carefully trying to act the
best he could. He took a quick glance at Vorden, he must have been
imagining things, because he was seeing and feeling a strange power
coming from him, but that can't be possible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sure it's
definitely not him.&quot; Berg said.&quot; Do you mind if I go now?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nathan then went
down to sit in his large office chair, he looked outside and could
see the sky was now completely black and only the moonlight was out.
After letting out a big sigh he leaned back and put his legs on the
desk. &quot;Let's call it a day. It looks like I've wasted everyone's
time here for no reason.&quot; Nathan said. &quot;You're all free to
go home and remember to get a good rest.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was unsure
what had just happened, perhaps Berg really did see someone else
running through those halls and it wasn't him, but whatever the case
was they were now free to go. Quinn and Vorden looked at each other
and walked quickly out of the room. They had the urge to run but they
tried to walk in a slow and normal way, otherwise the others would
notice that something was up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before leaving
Vorden turned and said. &quot;Thank you Berg, I owe you one.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just remember
this for the future.&quot; Berg replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Outside Peter was
walking through the forest, he was no longer limping as his legs were
now fully healed. However the pain in his stomach still hadn't
disappeared. It was a strange feeling, Peter's mind was all there, it
was him and he could control his body, but all he could think about
was eating raw human flesh, he kept thinking about how delicious Earl
had tasted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not wanting to hurt
any of his friends he tried to go as far away from the school as
possible and before he released it he had ended up in the park forest
once again. &quot;Am I going to die if I don't find anything? Err,
anyone…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He slowly made his
way through the woods until eventually he had reached a pathway. The
pathway went around the outskirts of the woods and park until it
eventually had an entrance and an exit. One leading to the city and
the other leading back to the direction of the school. But it was
late at night and not many people would be walking through the park
to head to the center of the city as all the shops would be closed by
now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing that
was still open were convenience shops that were stationed just a
little bit before the park. &quot;Should I head to the convenience
store? Maybe I can find someone and follow them back, pull them into
the woods.&quot; Peter was saying to himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Peter was
thinking of going through with his own suggestion he spotted someone
walking down the path. His body wanted to lunge out at the person but
Peter tried to fight against it, staying in the woods. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly the person
stopped and stood still. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Vorden
started to head back to their dorm room, making sure not to go too
fast. They didn't want another situation where a student would see
them running through the halls, which would draw attention and make
them look suspicious. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as they walked
through the halls several thoughts were running through both of their
minds. Quinn could no longer feel the connection between himself and
Peter, while Vorden was kicking himself for not making sure that
Peter and Layla were okay. He just never thought Peter would get
hungry so quickly, he only ate Earl yesterday. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had finally
arrived just outside the room and when they opened the door, the
first thing they saw, was the broken window and glass shards all over
the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Huh, where's
Layla?&quot; Quinn asked. &quot;You don't think Peter already…ate
her do you? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But if that was the
case Quinn would have gotten a message from the system, and also
there was no blood to be seen in the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when they
heard a small little sobbing sound coming from one of the corners. As
they turned their heads to see where the sound was coming from, they
could see Layla curled up into a ball sobbing in the corner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh.&quot;
Quinn said with a sigh of relief. &quot;You're still alive.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla looked up and
noticed the two had arrived back together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Where were you
guys!&quot; Layla said with an angry tone. &quot;I can't believe you
left me on my own, you know I'm not strong enough to deal with
something like this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was clear Layla
had been given quite a shock. Quinn did his best to calm her down. He
looked at her sobbing away and didn't know what to do in this type of
situation, he had never encountered a girl crying before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a memory came
into his head, one that he had almost forgotten. When he was only
three years old, Quinn had gotten lost from his mother in the
supermarket. The place seemed to be a whole different world to him at
the time. He felt alone frightened and when his mom finally found
him. She had given him a big hug that made all the bad feelings go
away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, Quinn
wrapped his hands around Layla tightly. &quot;It's okay, don't worry
Layla, I'm sorry about all of this. It's all my fault, I should have
known better.&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Layla was
frightened, she had expected Quinn to do something like this. The hug
felt nice and warm and reminded her of her family. But what actually
made everything even better was the look on Vorden's face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some reason when
Vorden saw this he had the look of worry on his face. Layla thought
that perhaps it was jealously because she was getting closer to
Quinn. But actually Vorden worried about Sil. Luckily Sil was quietly
sleeping inside the dark room and didn't get to see this scene. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The hug went on for
a while to the point where it seemed to be getting awkward for Layla.
This was because Quinn was unsure about the appropriate amount of
time to hug someone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, I'm
okay now. You can let go.&quot; Layla said as she made sure to wipe
away the remaining tears from her face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla, you
need to tell us what happened, where's Peter?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla recalled the
events of what happened while the two of them were away, saying that
it hadn't happened that long ago, around 15 minutes had passed. This
coincided with when Quinn had felt the connection between the two of
them got lost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If he's
outside I have to go find him, before we have another Earl situation
on our hands.&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is bad.&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;Especially since they already suspect us, we can't
deal with a situation like this right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then started
to get ready to leave the room. &quot;You two stay here, if worst
comes to worst I can use my shadow skill to hide myself. Besides even
if someone saw me they won't know who I am.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Vorden shouted. &quot;I'm coming with you. If Peter is like Layla
says he is, then you're going to need me. We're just going to have to
go through with plan B.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't like
it, he didn't like it one bit. Whatever happened he didn't want to go
through with Plan B no matter what, but right now, what choice did
they have? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, come
on let's go.&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Layla, it might be best if you
head back to your own room. Also if you can prepare some blood for
me, I might need it when I come back.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla nodded as the
two of them went off downstairs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Quinn sometimes, I
think you're too nice for this world.' Layla thought. After clearing
away the broken pieces of glass Layla decided to head towards her own

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter's senses were
all over the place. He couldn't even tell what was in front of him,
everything just seemed on high alert, and his vision was quite
blurry, while the smells all around him were overwhelming. The grass
underneath his feet, the wood sap form the trees it was hard to keep
them all separate in his mind. In the end the only thing he could
concentrate on was the human shaped figure in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The pain had gotten
the better of him, and he would now do anything to get rid of that
hunger. As Fex saw the ghoul leap out from the forest, he prepared
himself by getting into a fighting stance. It had leapt quite a
distance from the forest and out onto the path. While it was in the
air it had stuck out all of its limbs very wide, like it was some
type of beast. Then at the right moment, Fex lifted his head of the
ground and swung it outward like a whip hitting Peter right in the
center of his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He went flying
through the air quite a distance away until his body banged on the
floor and skittered away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well that
should keep it down for a while.&quot; Fex said to himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, nearly
instantly Peter was standing up once again. A few of his ribs had
been broken in the process but they regenerated almost instantly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Peter
was a ghoul, Fex was sure he had used enough force to take one out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is he starved?
Now who would be stupid enough to turn someone and not have
everything prepared beforehand?&quot; Fex thought, not knowing how
Peter came to be a ghoul. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A starved ghoul
healed a lot quicker than usual and they were dangerous to go up
against even for Vampires. Still, this also came with their own
downsides. The more times it would heal itself, the more energy it
would use, it was basically starving itself more each time it healed,
and eventually there wouldn't be any energy left, and healing would
come to an end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter came rushing
forward once again but Fex didn't look too worried. &quot;I'm really
not into killing other people's family members, if I did then it
could start a civil war and I don't want to be the one to blame for
that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex then started to
fiddle about with his fingers, pulling them in and out as if he was
making something but when looking at his hands nothing could be seen.
With Peter coming closer to him he was finally ready. He ran towards
Peter and just when Peter was about to swing for his head, Fex ducked
at the right moment, he dashed forward not touching Peter but swiping
his hands around him in the process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This continued
onward for a while, Peter would strike while Fex would dodge staying
close to him, moving his hands but not touching. Then Peter started
to notice something, his own movements where getting slower and
slower as the fight continued, his arms were the first to slow down
and eventually it was his legs. When he looked down and noticed what
was happening it was too late. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had fallen to
the ground and was now comply tangled and tied up in some type of
string. &quot;It's a shame, if you worked for me I could turn you
into a really good puppet. Your quite strong for a ghoul, it took
more strength then I thought to slow you down.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Fex started to
think of puppets, another person came into his mind, the girl who had
frozen him to the wall. &quot;Now, she would make a perfect human
puppet. I wonder if she would accept.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex then knelt down
and looked at Peter who was trying his best to break free, but the
string was almost indestructible and was being powered by Fex's MC.
He then lifted Peter's head off the ground and looked into his eyes
casting some type of spell. &quot;Suppress the hunger within
yourself, calm down.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After saying those
words Peter felt something inside his body change, the hunger
suddenly didn't feel as bad as before and he was slowly starting to
get a hold of himself a bit more. He could now see the person in
front of him clearly, he also noticed that this person smelt
different, different to other people anyway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I didn't
create you so the spell won't last for long.&quot; Fex explained.
&quot;Now tell me, which family do you belong too? If you're a crazed
ghoul you couldn't have been turned too long ago, otherwise you would
have evolved by now. Are you even registered, is that why you won't
speak?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Fex was
saying these words. Peter didn't understand any of it, he understood
the words individually but had no clue what was happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing that Peter
would no longer answer. Fex let go of his head allowing it to fall to
the ground. &quot;These damn ghouls there always loyal to their
leader, it was a waist trying to get anything out of him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey you know
if you don't eat something soon, you will get us caught, and you know
when that happens you're whole family will be punished for it.&quot;
Fex was now sitting on the floor calmly talking to Peter. Even though
Peter had just tried to attacking him, he was wondering why this
person wasn't angry with him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was a first in
Peter's whole life, if he ever tried fighting back even just once,
then the punishment would come back around tenfold. He learned that
quickly during his school days so he decided to never fight back
again. But this time Peter was the one attacking someone, and it was
clear this person was a lot stronger then him, so why wasn't he being
hit, stabbed burnt or even killed. Peter just couldn't understand it.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean my family?&quot; Peter finally answered. &quot;They have nothing
to do with this, they're just normal shopkeepers, keep them out of
this. It was my fault that I attacked you, just punish me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing Peter's
words, Fex felt like something wasn't quite right about this whole
thing. However he didn't have long to think about it, for suddenly
out from the side a big line of red blood was shot out. Fex didn't
even notice it until the last moment causing him to take the blow
with his bare hands. He was pushed back a few feet before he could
break the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He wasn't wearing
any beast gear on his body, and the same could be said for his hands
as well. Blood was now dripping from his forearms where the attacks
had wounded him. But what was most surprising to Fex was the fact
that he recognized the attack. It was a blood attack that only other
vampires could use. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he looked up,
he could see what could only be described as a demon. White hollow
menacing eyes, with a mask in a Japanese demon design covering his
mouth. As Peter looked up, even he didn't recognize the figure
standing in front of him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is that thing
even comfortable, I imagine it must be pretty tight down there?&quot;
Fex said sarcastically while glancing at the strange person's groin
area. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While moving closer
to the mysterious figure, Fex made sure not to make any sudden
movements. The wounds on his forearms were already starting to heal,
so they didn't bother him much anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, I know
you might just be trying to save this...&quot; Fex then looked at
Peter who was lying on the floor between them. &quot;…Human, I
guess. But I think you don't understand, I've tied him up for your
and everybody else's safety. I suggest you go back home so we can
forget any of this ever happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he got closer Fex
started to notice something, or rather the absence of something. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Where's his scent?
I'm not smelling anything from him.' He thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, humans and
vampires had this aroma around them, everybody has a specific smell.
It was what attracted humans around them. Although vampires could
suppress this to some extent, they could never completely get rid of
it, especially not in front of other vampires. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But for the first
time he met a person who had no scent at all, because of this he
couldn't identify this mysterious person or even guess his race, this
made him a bit more careful around this suspicious person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn, on the other
hand, had no clue of his suits side effect. While wearing the mask,
he wasn't able to use his nose to its full capacity. The suit that
blocked out the sun, was also blocking out his smell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's mind was
occupied with other things right now, he was trying to decide if he
had to kill this person or not. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The question was;
Had Peter attacked this person to try and eat him, and did the person
manage to defend himself, and also tie Peter up with his ability? Or
had nothing happened yet, and had this person randomly attacked Peter
and then tied him up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some reason
Peter was very calm right now, this was not what Quinn had been
expecting, because before he lost all sense of control over Peter
through their bond. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's identity was
still a secret, at least for now. His number one priority was getting
Peter out of the situation and back to their dorm room. He could deal
with any other issues later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had a feeling
from the way Fex was moving, that he was being cautious. If Quinn was
going to make a dash for it to get Peter out, the most likely outcome
would be that a fight was going to break out. If that was the case,
it would be best if Quinn first found out his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After seeing the
information Quinn froze for a bit, he had to re-read it twice just to
make sure what he saw was correct. After what the blond vampire in
the system had said he knew there had to be other vampires out there.
But he never expected to see one in the same school as him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a horrible
thought ran through his mind, he remembered what the blond vampire in
the system had told him, now that he was a vampire they would come
after him and to be careful of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was too soon,
Quinn didn't even know how strong he was compared to other vampires.
If this new vampire wanted to take Peter away then he could have him.
Quinn wanted to change things, but that wasn't going to be possible
with him dead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But when Quinn tried
to run away, something inside of him gave him a jolt, a force was
pulling him towards Peter and refusing to let him leave. At the same
time, Peter was feeling the same thing. Quinn then fell down on one
knee, breathing heavy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this?&quot;
Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's your
family bond,&quot; the system explained. &quot;The two of you are
bonded by the magic of your blood. Similar to how Peter can never do
you, as his master, any harm, you can never desert him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is this
vampire family crap,&quot; Quinn said as he got up from the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he couldn't run
away without Peter, then he only had one choice. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right in front of
Fex's eyes, his opponent had disappeared, and without giving off any
smell, it was hard for him to locate this person. &quot;So it looks
like you're going to try and fight me. Well, you made the wrong
decision!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, a tingling
feeling he felt in his neck alerted him that something was coming. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A claw like blood
mark randomly came out from his right side, and behind it, several
more followed. However, before the attack left Quinn's hands, Fex was
able to retaliate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Blood
barrier.&quot; Swiping his hands upward, a thin red barrier was
formed. As each swipe hit the barrier, it would shake a little but
was completely unaffected by the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But seeing Quinn's
attack made Fex realise something. The attack produced just now was a
blood swipe, it was the same basic skill all vampires were required
to learn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait you're a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Quinn
could hear Fex's words, he chose to ignore them over the systems, it
was quite possible this whole thing was an act. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was hoping the
daze skill would go through allowing him to flash step behind his
opponent and perform a hammer strike, but it had failed making him
change plans. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Putting both of his
hands together, Quinn formed a larger blood swipe throwing out a
single large attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, if this
ghoul belongs to your family maybe I can help you, we can figure out
something together.&quot; Seeing the red line of attack, Fex had no
choice. He too placed both hands together and let out a blood swipe
of his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Only his was
significantly larger than Quinn's. As the two blood swipes collided,
Fex's consumed Quinn's and carried on going forward, the only thing
Quinn could do, was use his flash step to avoid the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then activated
his boots, if his Blood swipe wasn't strong enough then he would need
to rely on his speed, he went in close and threw out a fist
performing Blood spray at the same time. However, each attack was
deflected by Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After seeing Quinn
struggling in hand to hand combat, Fex found everything quite
strange. &quot;Does he not even know the basic martial arts?&quot; It
was something all vampires were required to learn, but Quinn was
throwing his punches out quite randomly, but then he also knew some
advance skills such as the flash step. So he couldn't be a beginner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you keep
going like this, you'll die before giving me a chance to help you,&quot;
Fex said, with urgency in his voice. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had used up a

to be working. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Just get out

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, Fex was
confused, but this time by the ghoul. If they belonged to the same
family, the blood bond wouldn't allow one to be deserted in time of
need. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With nothing
working, Quinn only had one choice. He threw out a blood swipe and
caught it using his shadow control, with the scythe being held in his
hands and his suit of armour and mask on, he truly looked like a grim

that Quinn would need him once they found Peter. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he was only a
short distance away from the park, where he assumed Quinn was heading
to, his watch lit up and the sound of a notification was heard. When
he looked at the watch, the time stated that it was 9:45. This meant
that they only had fifteen minutes before curfew time. In most cases,
it wouldn't be so bad, since students would just be brought in and be

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A snarling sound was
made as if to give a warning for Quinn not to get any closer. Peter's
eyes were now red once again, and his fangs were on full display. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Positive,
vampires have a set of rules that they must follow, otherwise, their
own powers will begin to retaliate to them. Remember how you felt
just moments ago when you tried to flee, right? No matter how hard
you fought against it, it was impossible to fight back. It will be
the same for him if he tries to hurt you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at Peter who
continued to snarl at him, he still wasn't quite sure whether to
believe the system or not, but he had no choice. Peter was like this
because of him, and now, there was no going back. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The snarling
persisted as he went forward, but exactly as the system had said,
even though Quinn was practically holding Peter's head, he never
tried to bite him. Quinn then lifted his hand and started to squeeze
the blood from it, allowing it to drip into Peter's mouth. Just like
that, in almost an instant, Peter started to calm down. </FONT></FONT>

made it back into the room on time, and Layla had left long before to
go back to her dorm room. In the kitchen, laid out on the table, he
had gotten what looked like a meat cleaver. &quot;Okay Vorden, you
can do this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then placed
his arm on the table, laying it flat, while grabbing the meat cleaver
with the other. &quot;Here goes nothing!&quot; He swung it down, but
at the last second, he stopped just inches above his limb. &quot;I
can't do it. How can anyone cut their own arm off?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A thud sound was

through the broken window. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The sound on their

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, as soon as
Peter had entered the room, the smell of a fresh human flesh had
entered his nose, and he once again succumbed to his crazed self.
Quinn quickly held him down using all of his strength, but the
struggle was tough. It felt like Peter was just as strong as Quinn.
The only thing that he could do was to put on his gauntlets, but if
he did, the second he let go of Peter, he knew he would go after
Vorden. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now is not the

looked at the meat cleaver and his hand, his heart started beating
like crazy. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Argh, you big

Without hesitation, Raten swung the meat cleaver down on to his own
arm. Unlike Vorden though, he didn't hesitate one bit. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, the bone was
thick and he wasn't able to be cut off the arm cleanly in one go.
Blood kept on spilling out of the wound. Raten lifted it up and
continued to hack at his own limb until eventually, his arm had
completely come off. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden's arm was
flying through the air, Peter managed to overpower Quinn and push him
off. Peter leapt into the air like a dog trying to catch the arm, it
would have looked funny, if it wasn't so gruesome. It was as if he
was playing catch, but instead of a stick, he was catching an arm,
his jaws extended much further than would be possible for a normal
human, when he caught the arm in his mouth he immediately bit down on
it and started eating. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden looked down
at the meat cleaver, it was covered in blood and so was the kitchen
counter where he had cut his arm off, strangely there wasn't any
blood on the hand holding the cleaver. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, are

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,

we needed plan B more than we thought.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn looked at
Vorden he had expected to see blood gushing from the wound where he
had cut off his own arm, instead he saw that the wound had closed
itself and was already starting to heal bit by bit. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the same time,
Peter was still gnawing away on Vorden's arm, entirely focused on
devouring it skin and bone. Vorden felt a bit strange, seeing Peter
eating his arm right in front of him. Instinctively he grabbed at his
arm, he felt the part below his elbow was already starting to grow
back, this made him sigh in relief, luckily the healing ability he
acquired was already starting to work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I hope this is

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It should be,
when he's finished eating he will calm down a bit,&quot; Quinn
replied. He was just repeating the words of the system right now,
because he wasn't sure of anything anymore. When Peter finally
finished eating the arm, Quinn felt strange energy surging through
his body, it felt the same as the first time Peter ate human flesh. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a strange

happening, but he didn't have control over his body, because he was
fully consumed by his hunger. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at Vorden,
Peter noticed his arm was missing. With fear in his voice he
stammered, &quot;Vorden... your arm.... I don't know...&quot; Peter
felt appalled with himself. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This thing?&quot;
Vorden said as he lifted his stump. &quot;Don't worry about it, in a
few hours it will have grown back. This was our backup plan in case
you lost control before we had found a permanent solution for you. I
just didn't want you thinking of me like a chicken nugget you can eat
whenever you get hungry.&quot; Vorden said trying to lighten the
mood. &quot;Before coming back to our room, I went down to the
canteen and copied the ability of a student who has regenerative
power. We didn't expect you to be hungry so soon, after you fed on
Earl only yesterday.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All three of them
were silent for a while, they were thinking about the crazy situation
that they were in right now. After some time Peter broke the silence,
&quot;Thank you, the both of you. You have always been nice to me,
and treated me right, even after I betrayed you, you still saved my
life, and even now you went to such lengths to help me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they looked
around the room they realized how much of a mess they had made. There
was a big hole in the window were Peter had smashed through it, and
shards of broken glass could be seen underneath it. Blood was all
over the place: on the kitchen counter, on the floor where Peter had
devoured the arm, even on the ceiling from when the arm had flown
through the air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, I guess
we better get started with cleaning this place before anyone finds
out what happened here,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of them took it
in turn cleaning up the place but there wasn't much they could do
about some area, they couldn't magically restore a window, and the
scratches made on the wooden floor could only be fixed so much. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden was
cleaning the kitchen counter he said, &quot;Hey Quinn, you fancy a
drink?&quot; At the same time, he was squeezing some blood from a
towel. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was amazed at
how Vorden could still crack a joke in a situation like this, but
then again nothing ever seemed to faze the guy. Since turning into a
vampire, Quinn wasn't affected much by the sight of blood anymore,
even Peter eating Vorden's arm didn't bother him much. What surprised
him was how well Vorden was handling it. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While they were busy
cleaning up, Quinn had the chance to ask the system some questions,
because right now he had a lot of them. &quot;Do you know how long
Peter will be required to eat human flesh?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn found the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Me?&quot; the
system replied. &quot;I see why you would think so, I was designed
after the original owner, the person who's the idea it was to create
the system. My thoughts, my actions everything is based around him.
However, the system itself was created by someone else, and before
you ask, the man often changed names throughout time so even if I
told you his name, you wouldn't know who he is.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since there wasn't
much Quinn could do about the system for now and it wasn't really a
problem he decided to focus on the other matter. Looking at the quest
he noticed something that would cause them even more problems. The
quest stated that they would need seven different types of human
flesh. Just like Quinn with his blood, he would only get stronger
when consuming a new person's blood, the same could be said for
Peter, who would have to consume different types of flesh. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two day rest
period was over, and students were now required to go back to classes
as usual. Vorden, Peter and Quinn didn't feel like they had rested at
all. Over the last few days, they had experienced one high tense
situation after another. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the morning Quinn
and Peter didn't go down to the canteen for breakfast, they had
decided to stay in their dorm room. While Vorden still had the
regenerative ability, he had decided to cut off another one of his
limbs, but Vorden actually looked scared about cutting off his own
body part again. At first, Quinn was against him doing it again, but
Vorden had convinced him it was necessary to make sure Peter wouldn't
go crazy with hunger again today. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn had
finally agreed, they decided to cut off a bigger limb, because it
would give Peter more meat to feed on. Eventually, they chose to cut
off one of Vorden's legs. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn couldn't bear
for Vorden to go through so much pain again, that's why he offered to
help, with his greater strength he was able to cut through the entire
leg in one clean stroke. It took Quinn some time to mentally prepare
for it, but he finally convinced himself that it would mean less pain
for Vorden, which gave him the resolve he needed to do it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden looked scared
when Quinn was about to cut his limb off, but all of a sudden his
facial expression changed, instead of fear it now showed anger.
Vorden shouted at Quinn, &quot;Just do it, you little wimp!&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After eating human
flesh for two days in a row, it seemed like normal raw meat was no
longer an option for Peter, when he tried to eat it, he immediately
threw it back up, like his body was rejecting the raw animal meat.
From now on Peter would only be able to eat raw human flesh. Quinn
was quite upset about this, because he didn't want to see Vorden go
through this painful process again. Quinn now wanted Peter to evolve
as soon as possible, as hopefully, this would help with Peters
dietary problems. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Vorden went
down to the canteen to eat, Peter was looking at the black bag with
Vorden's leg in it. He couldn't stop himself from drooling, and his
saliva was dripping out of his mouth and falling onto the floor. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you going
to eat that or what? Don't let Vorden's sacrifice go to waste.&quot;
Quinn said, while holding a glass of Vorden's blood in his hand. They
had collected it after cutting Vorden's arm off, it would have been a
shame to let it go to waste. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn swirled the
blood around in the glass before he drank it all in one big gulp. It
tasted nice and sweet, and when he was finished drinking he had a
smile on his face. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How do you do
it?&quot; Peter asked with awe and horror on his face. &quot;How can
you be so calm about it all? How do you deal with this sudden change
so easily?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Trust me on
this one Peter, at first I didn't,&quot; Quinn replied looking
pensive. &quot;Think of it this way, everyone has multiple sides that
they show to people, they are different with their family members,
compared to their friends, and they are different with their
girlfriends compared to their family and friends. But does that mean
those other sides don't exist when they are with different people? We
choose to show people which side of us we want them to see, this way
different people will form different opinions of us. I was scared
too, but I choose not to show it to others. I was also very lucky
that I found someone who helped me deal with everything.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he was saying
this to Peter, his mind had immediately gone to Layla. Like he told
Peter, he was extremely lucky that she was the first person who found
out about his secret. Since she found out she had been nothing but
supportive, she also helped him learn a lot about being a vampire. He
wondered how different things might have been if it wasn't for her. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was
talking to him Peter had been trying to hold back from eating the leg
that was in front of him. However he could no longer stop himself, as
Peter started chomping down on Vorden's leg, Quinn turned around to
look away, even though it didn't bother him much it still felt wrong
to him looking at one friend eating another friend's leg. Quinn also
realized he thought of Peter as a friend again, he suspected the
strange bond between them might have something to do with this. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden was done
with breakfast, he had returned to the dorm room to collect Peter, he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because the two days
of rest were over, every student was required to start training in
their combat classes again. Peter was still registered in the
elemental ability class. He was currently known as an earth user, and
Vorden had a feeling that Duke was keeping an eye on him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Peter had told
them that Duke had gifted him with the level two, three and four
earth ability books, Vorden was puzzled by this, he couldn't
understand why Duke had given Peter those books. The only thing they
knew was that for whatever reason, Duke wanted Peter to become a
level four earth ability user. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
split up, Peter and Vorden went to the elemental class, while Quinn
went to his own combat class. Now that Peter had been fed twice in a
short time, the system assured Quinn that he could last at least
twenty four hours before he needed to feed again. In that time Quinn
needed to come up with a solution, or if he couldn't, he would have
to find Fex and ask him for help. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While everyone was
looking at the teacher, Vorden noticed that a couple of students had
come over to where Peter was standing, and it looked like they were
nudging him a bit. The three of them started to move away from the
crowd, towards the back of the classroom, out of sight of the main
group of students. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had never seen
these two students before and was a bit afraid, but when they
approached him, and he saw they both had power levels of 2.4 and 2.6
he was no longer worried. One of the students whispered into Peter's
ear, &quot;Move to the back of the classroom&quot;. Once they were at
the back, one of them whispered again saying, &quot;Duke has a
message for you, make sure you bring your earth ability up to level
four by the end of the week, if you do there will be even more
rewards for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter agreed,
because he didn't know what else to do. As he looked down at his
watch, all he could see was the number one. Now that he had become a
ghoul he couldn't even use his earth ability anymore, he was
wondering how he was going to solve this in a weeks' time. 'Quinn can
change the number on his watch by tapping it, maybe I can ask him how
he does that?' Peter thought. </FONT></FONT>

that morning and tried his best to fit in during his time at school.
He hadn't thought much about what happened last night, and he really
didn't care that much about it. He was just trying to help a fellow

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After staying at the

the school was quite boring. He had gone out to the city to talk to
others and experienced some new things, but doing things alone on his

chalked this up to being the new kid. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Images would appear
of certain people doing strange things with each other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn had
no clue what was going on, he was just happy it didn't seem like she
was freaking out about the whole thing. It seemed like because Erin
grew up knowing nothing about them, it really didn't come as a shock
to her because she had no point of reference. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the way there,
Quinn was thinking of possible safe ways to approach Fex. He would
need to talk to him in a public place where he couldn't use his
abilities as freely, but before that he needed to find out what class
he was in or where he was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They arrived in the
large training hall, and Leo was there as usual. They hadn't seen
each other since he had saved them from the Dalki and the girls were
a lot warmer to him now. As soon as they entered, Leo looked over to
their direction and smiled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I didn't
know any better, I would have thought he could see us. &quot; Layla
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He probably
just knows where the entrance is, and when he hears students
footsteps, he smiles at us,&quot; Erin replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn had a
feeling that wasn't true, as he hadn't seen Leo smile at the other
students before, and it seemed to be only directed at the three. What
they didn't know was Quinn's aura was always easy to spot, and as
soon as he stepped in the room, Leo immediately knew it was Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This time Leo had
all the students gather at the front of the training hall where a
small platform had been raised. The platform was a similar size to a
boxing ring, only there were no ropes, and it was raised about a foot
off the ground. Leo stood on top of this platform as he explained the
upcoming lesson to everyone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, just before
the lesson started, a new student had entered the room, Leo was
completely distracted as he noticed something, for this student had
the exact same aura as Quinn did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, this is
the Beast Weapons class, right?&quot; Fex said as he walked through. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think it's a
new student.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This late into
the term, that means he must be a draft evader.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they looked at
Fex, their interest quickly died down after seeing he only had the
number one on his watch. He wasn't worth them even getting to know,
and it would only waste their time. Seeing this Fex was once again
annoyed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What is wrong with
these people,' Fex thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he said those
words, he started to sniff about in the air. Something seemed to
catch his attention. He moved closer towards the smell, until
finally, he realised where it was coming from. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And Quinn looked at
Fex the same. They both knew instantly that this was the person who
they had fought with last night. Fex gave Quinn one look up and down
before walking off to find his own spot to watch the lesson from. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This reaction
surprised Quinn, to say the least. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Isn't he going to
say anything? I'm sure he realised I was the person fighting him last
night. If I can smell him, he can definitely smell me.' Quinn
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Fex wasn't
bothered in other people's business, and that included Vampires, he
already gave out a lending hand, and if Quinn didn't want to take it,
that was fine with him. As long as Quinn didn't try to get in his
way, then there was no trouble between the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The lesson had
started, but it was hard for Quinn to concentrate. Still, the lesson
seemed to be an important one, so Quinn tried his best to listen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you all
know, we have been learning the basics of each weapon. I haven't
taught you how to use each weapon individually but only explained how
to activate the Beasts Weapons power for a greater result.&quot; Leo
explained as he drew out his katana blade. &quot;But there will be
times where one's weapon will break or certain weapons will prove
ineffective against the enemy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then threw his
blade at the wall behind him. It flew fast, and half of the blade
managed to go into the wall until it stopped. &quot;In these times we
will have to use our own fists.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students started
to mumble, using fists against beats and the Dalki sounded barbaric
to them, almost suicidal. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If we have

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, and even
then if I didn't have a beast weapon or was too tired to use my
ability, surely guns would be better?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students started
to mock and laugh at Leo quietly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see, so you

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were unaware
that Leo could hear everything they were saying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Leo
started to tear off his military clothing and underneath he revealed
a chest piece armour that had the face of a demon on it. That's when
the students also noticed he was even wearing beast gear on his feet
as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin, Layla and

Leo had worn when he killed the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You all know
that our old technology, our weapons were useless against them, and
our nuclear weapons were rendered useless before we even had the
chance to try them. Even armour piercing bullets from a sniper rifle
at most could knock a single scaled Dalki back. However, when
activating the beast gear, the higher-level tier of equipment, the
more empowered our bodies become.&quot; Leo said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, the
students thought they imagined it, but they could all see clearly
that the Blackish armour around Leo's chest was starting to light up
and turn red, little particles of steam were emerging from the piece
as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Right now if I
was to throw a fist with all my force, I could crumble the
foundations of this entire building.&quot; The steam started to
disappear, and the chest pieces colour started to return to normal. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that time, the
students realised a certain pressure had disappeared, as if they were
under a gravity heavier than they were used to had disappeared from
the room. They didn't need Leo to demonstrate, they could all feel
the power he held in his hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So they
finally figured out how to properly use the power of the beasts,
huh.&quot; Fix said. &quot;Well looks like they advanced quicker than
my father said they would.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The power of
the fist is useless if you cannot hit your opponent, or if you do not
know how to throw a punch,&quot; Leo explained. &quot;So for today's
lesson, I shall be showing you a basic martial art that all soldiers
are required to learn. For this, I will need a volunteer.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ever since evolving
into a vampire Quinn's looks had slightly changed. He was no longer
the weak skinny frail him. his body had filled up, and he looked like
he had a proportion of muscles all over. The students never paid much

as a target to pick on. Now standing in front of the class they were

did give Quinn an idea. So far each level up required him to earn

able to move his head to avoid it—Quinn then changed his fist and
went to grab Leo instead. He hoped to throw Leo to the ground but it
was too late.The man had already pivoted on his foot and went for a
spin—while doing so he lifted his other leg in the air and managed
to kick Quinn right in the head. At first, Quinn thought he could
take the blow from the older man but he quickly realised his mistake.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Fex was
growing up, he had always been told how weak humans were. How they
had to rely on the power of others to survive but after seeing Leo,
he could tell this wasn't true, or at least what they used to know
about humans, no longer applied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before heading up to
the stage, Fex looked around the room and spotted Erin, to his
surprise she was standing right next to Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He didn't
already make her his, did he, But how? My charm didn't even work

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group caught Fex
looking over in their direction, then next thing they noticed was a
cheesy wink with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, they
all wondered who the wink was directed at and cringed a little
inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That wink
wasn't towards you was it?&quot; Layla asked thinking it was meant
for Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess?&quot;
Quinn replied, it had to be at him he thought, he was the only one
who knew who Fex was and he was looking right at them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the wink
was actually directed at Erin, she had no clue of this either, in
fact, she could hardly remember seeing the boy. The only thing that
kept happening for some reason was, whenever she looked at him, her
face would start to heat up a little as she felt embarrassed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe he has a
thing for you?&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla's words had
jolted Erin's memory, and she remembered where she had seen the boy
before, when she was in the library reading a particular book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, that has
to be the reason,&quot; Erin said nervously. She felt like the wink
must have been a sign, perhaps he was planning to use it as blackmail
against her. Tell everyone that she read those type of books. If
others were to find out, her family even. She would be shamed for
having such a dirty mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She needed to keep
the boy silent no matter what. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now Fex and Leo were
up on stage and even Quinn was a little excited to see the outcome of
the match. He had fought with both of them and pretty much lost.
Still, he was unable to get either of them to show their full
strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Quinn,&quot;
Layla whispered. &quot;Is he a vampire as well?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How did you
know?&quot; Quinn thought. Unless she had a nose like his, Fex looked
just like every other human. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, you've
been acting strangely ever since he got in here, and you did tell us
someone attacked you last night right. Well, who do you thinks going
to win?&quot; She asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not sure.
I was just thinking that myself, If it was just hand to hand combat,
I felt more useless fighting against Leo. Not only that but, Leo has
years of experience. I just can't see a student beating him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then went to
have a closer look at Fex; he did indeed seem young. The same age as
all of them. &quot;Well if it's like the books I've read, vampires
can live for a lot longer then humans, some of them are eternal, so
maybe he looks young just because he wants to.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is that true?&quot;
Quinn asked the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, Vampires
are able to slow down the ageing process, although there are methods
when doing this. A vampire can either go into eternal slumber. It's a
method they use to stop there heart beating and everything inside
their body. In a way, it's a near death-like state. The only way to
wake Vampire from eternal slumber is to have them take a drop of
blood from the same family. During this period they will not age, and
their body will not deteriorate, the second method, well let's just
say the second method isn't very nice.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had long
learnt if the system didn't want to elaborate on any details, even if
Quinn asked, it would choose to remain quiet. It made him wonder just
who was able to create such an advanced AI, to the point where it
seemed no different from a human. No technology that he knew of, was
able to do that yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, if this
Vampire is a lot older then he looks then maybe him and Leo will be
evenly matched,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I doubt that.&quot;
The system added. &quot;The boy in front of you, I don't have any
memory of him in our records and the way he acts, would also suggest
he has a young mind. If I was to take a guess, he should be no older
than you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Watching this fight
would be an excellent insight for Quinn. He still had no idea how
strong other vampires were and this would be the first look at
another one for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo got into the
same fighting stance as before and moved his fingers, telling Fex to
come forward. Unlike Quinn, Fex didn't rush ahead and calmly walked
over. Then when their fists were a touching distance away. Fex got
into a fighting stance of his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at the
two, their fighting stances were quite different. Leo had both hands
out in front of him, similar to Karate or a little like boxing, while
Fex had both hands down by his side but his knees were slightly bent.
Slowly Fex was circling Leo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The tension was
high, not knowing when either of them would attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was the first to
strike; he came in throwing his fists in quick succession, two to the
head and then another to the body. However, just like before, by
using his palms, Leo was able to knock them away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'He could block
them!' Fex thought. 'But I only pulled back on my speed a little, I
was sure from watching the match earlier this would be fast enough.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After blocking the
attacks, Leo followed up with a kick aiming towards Fix's head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Fex
jumped Back and tried to grab the leg, but at the last second it
seemed like the angle had changed causing Fex's grab to miss. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Again, it's like he
knows what I'm going to do.' Fex inwardly was starting to get
annoyed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then while bringing
his leg back, he was able to catch Fex on the head with the heel of
his foot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He didn't use
that against the last student? &quot; Someone from the crowd said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Touching the mark on
his face Fex smiled. &quot;Looks like I need to bring it up a notch.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex went in and did
the same, throwing punches rapidly only this time, in the same amount
of time he had thrown three to the head and three to the body. Leo
was able to block the first three and the second two but the last one
had gotten in and hit him in the stomach. He felt the powerful blow
that had the weight of a hammer but didn't let it distract him
throwing out his own sequence of kicks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fight now
continued with no breaks in between, while one focused on their
fists, the other focused using their legs to attack. They would block
each other's strikes while hitting each other once in the while. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Ha, I don't know
what father was talking about, they aren't weak at all.' As the fight
continued, Fex got more excited, and he started putting more power
into his punches. It got to the point where it was power beyond a
regular human with no ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo could feel this
and could sense the energy inside him getting wilder. At first he
thought he had never seen such a fighting style or martial art
before, So Leo decided to lead him on, hoping he would reveal
everything he had, but perhaps he had played with the boy too long. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking at his

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far, the fight
had shown an amazing set of skills from both of the contenders. Leo
had displayed some techniques that he hadn't used in the battle
against Quinn, making him realise how much better Fex was at
fighting. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Leo felt
like he had allowed the fight to go on for too long, turning Fex into
an over-confident lad. Although he was banned to use his abilities,
Leo's was slightly different compared to the others. His ability was
always on. He needed it as he used it as a type of vision for
himself. Since he was blind, he would constantly activate his ability
to see the aura of living things around him. In turn, this also
allowed him to see the flow of energy in the body of his opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When an opponent
attacks, their energy flow would move before the body of the person
did. This was the same when a person used their abilities as well. If
Leo concentrated by just a half, he could change his vision to almost
a birds-eye view. Being able to sense all those around him, it was
thanks to this skill that he was able to survive countless near-death
situations during the war. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, even if
others were to have this ability, it would be useless in the hands of
someone who was unable to exploit it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex threw out stiff
and straight fast blows with his fist, but knowing what he was going
to do beforehand, Leo was able to block all of the attacks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'What? But I was
sure I increased the speed quick enough so he won't be able to block
it.' Fex thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, when Leo
prepared for a kick, he still could see where Fex was planning to
dodge. Using his other foot, he was able to shift his weight and
change the direction. It landed right in Fex's face, but Leo didn't
stop there since he knew the damage was minuscule. He continued to
kick in rapid successions, aiming for where Fex would be each time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Can he read my
mind? What's going on?' Fex asked himself out of frustration. Even he
was unable to comprehend what was happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the kicks
stopped for a breath of a second, Fex thought he had finally gotten a
break, but before he could do anything, another kick was aimed to him
from above - An axe kick which slammed down on the back of his head
as hard as he could. The blow was harder than Fex thought it would be
so he was unable to prepare himself in time, his legs gave in and his
head bounced off of the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He laid there, lying
lifelessly on the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did Leo just
kill him?&quot; A student said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Isn't that
going too far for a simple student?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before Leo himself
had realised it, he had been too consumed by his past memories. It
had affected his usual clear mind. However, he knew the student was
safe since his aura was still burning brightly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex slowly started
to get up, pushing his body up with his arms, with his nose slightly
bent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Unfortunately,
I didn't expect to meet such a skilled student that I seemed to have
taken the fight a little too seriously,&quot; Leo said. &quot;Just
think that you were lucky. If I was using a sword in this match, you
wouldn't be alive.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Standing on the
sidelines, Quinn was a little worried. This loss might have hurt
Fex's pride, causing him to go on a rampage. If that happend, he
didn't know what to do. But then, Fex's next actions surprised him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you for
the battle, teacher. You have taught me how useful your martial arts
truly are.&quot; Fex said as he bowed down and walked off of the
stage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Leo said. &quot;Please tell me, where did you learn to fight like
that?&quot; Leo had wanted to fight Fex after realising that he and
Quinn carried the same aura. Quinn excited him by showing amazing
growth each time, and he had expected Fex to be the same. Yet, Fex
was different - He was a few levels above Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you can
see, my ability is only a level 1. My family has always been weak, so
we decided to train in the form of martial arts to help build a good
foundation. &quot;Fex answered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing this,
the students quickly remembered that Fex was only a level one. When
they witnessed how good he was at fighting, some of them had the idea
of recruiting him for the next portal outing. Still, no matter how
skilled he was at fighting, it wouldn't help him against beasts.
Unlike Leo who had the power of the beast gear helping him, they all
felt like Fex could never obtain a piece of equipment that high in
level. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a strange
situation. He could be useful if he had high-level equipment, but he
would need to be strong enough to get the high-level equipment in the
first place. The only way they felt like Fex could move up the ladder
was to swear loyalty to a faction or the military, helping him raise
his ability to the point where he could get the appropriate gear. And
only then would he become someone who would be a threat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, Fex's
ability wasn't really level one, but due to the watch being unable to
detect a Vampire's Mc points, it displayed level one. As Fex walked
back to the crowd, he Quickly snapped his nose back into place. He
also had bruise marks all over his body, but they would soon heal, so
there wasn't much to worry about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the two
demonstrations over, it was time for Leo to start the class. Everyone
was asked to spread out so they would have space of their own in the
room. The first thing Leo started to demonstrate was the kicks. He
proceeded to demonstrate different types of kicks one by one, and the
rest of the class would follow step by step. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If felt a bit
awkward at first, and most of the students who had never done such a
thing found it quite difficult. However, Quinn's body was more
flexible and agile than most, allowing him to perform the moves
quicker and learn them faster than the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo could see this,
and once again, was impressed with how Quinn was performing, then
when he looked at the other person he was interested in, he felt a
little disappointed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex had decided not
to bother learning the kicks properly. It wasn't because he thought
they were useless or not helpful, he just found out first hand how
good the techniques were, but it was because vampires were very
traditional. If they were to alter their arts or try to use something
else, they would not be happy with him at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While performing the
different sets of kicks, Quinn started to have a thought. When
punching, he was able to combine the blood spray with it. When
throwing his fist, he used his blood swipe. Perhaps, there might be
some way to combine the blood swipe with his kicks, creating a new
skill of his own. Although, he would have to wait to practice this on
his own later. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo had demonstrated
a total of three different kicks; one was the roundhouse kick, which
was a kick that came out from the side; the other was using their
dominant foot, then they also had to practice the kick using their
subdominant foot; the third kick was the axe kick performed at the
end, lifting the leg upward and then down using your heel to hit the
enemy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once he had finished
demonstrating all the kicks, it was time for them to test them out
against each other. Leo asked the group to get into pairs and spar
with each other. However, they were only allowed to perform these
three kicks with each other while also only blocking using their legs
or dodging. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was Quinn's
chance to approach Fex as he could see he was all on his own since no
one wanted to pair up with him. </FONT></FONT>

the start that no one would want to go up against Fex. And this time,
it wasn't just because he was a level 1. He had put on an impressive
performance, and it was clear that if they were to go up against him,
they would stand no chance. If they lost to him in a spar, a level 1,
they would become the laughing stock of the whole room, and the

teamed up with Layla, and had lost his chance to get close to her.
Although, he noticed a smell gradually coming towards him - One he

unsure who exactly was this person, but to be sent to the base on his
own, he would have to be a high ranking member in their family. Or
maybe, in a similar situation to Fex himself. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess you
already know what I am,&quot; Quinn said while looking at Fex,
keeping his fist closed, ready for things to turn at any second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
who I am?&quot; Fex asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thanks to the
system's Inspect skill, Quinn did know. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fex Sanguinis,
correct?&quot; When Quinn answered, he was unsure what to say at
first. If he said his name, would Fex get suspicious of how Quinn
knew? Or would they think they were comrades? It was a risk. Quinn
had no clue how many vampires there were, and how close of a
relationship each one of them held with each other. Still, this way,
if he did ask how he knew his name, Quinn could make up a type of
lie. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, he chose
to reveal the Vampire's name as the system advised him to do. &quot;Quinn,
I'm warning you right now. Never reveal your family name to another
vampire. If you do, they will target you.&quot; The system said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But can't he
use his inspect skill as well?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That is unique
to the system, Quinn. You are not an ordinary vampire. The others
don't have this kind of system like yours. This whole thing you are
going through, you are the first person to experience it. Which is
why I can't help you as much along the way. There are even things
that I don't know about the system.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then started
to wonder, just which skills were unique to the system and what are
the skills that all vampires had knowledge of? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, it's to
be expected. I thought maybe my fame was starting to die around the
other families.&quot; Fex said, swiping his hair back. &quot;Well,
it's clear you're not from my family. Otherwise, you wouldn't have
attacked me yesterday, but I won't pry into your business because
that would just be rude of me. Anyway, go ahead. It seems you didn't
approach me for no reason at all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was struggling
with deciding on how much information he should reveal. If he made
one type of slipup, then it would reveal the position he was in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I remember you
saying that if I needed any help, you would offer your hand.&quot;
Quinn then took in a deep breath. &quot;I need you to help me with
the ghoul problem of mine - The one that you captured the other day.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex then smiled. &quot;I
thought as much. I see, perhaps a vampire recklessly transformed a
human huh, and then left you a halfling, or lesser, to deal with the
problems. Who would be so irresponsible to turn someone into a ghoul
without preparing everything beforehand?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It seemed like Fex
was coming up with his own ideas about why Quinn was here, which was
a good thing. It meant that Quinn didn't have to come up with his own
story and could just stay silent. In doing so, Fex was the type of
person who thought his guesses were right on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Judging by
your silence, I'm pretty close aren't I?&quot; He assumed as he
started laughing. &quot;Haha, when I become the family head, with my
genius brain, our family will rise to the head position.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So you can
help then?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By simply looking at
Quinn's face, and seeing his fighting skills the other day, Fex could
only surmise that Quinn wasn't well trained, or just wouldn't amount
to much in the future. This contradicted his earlier thought, though
there was something else that was bugging him. He had seen Quinn use
the shadow ability - It was an ability that the other vampires hadn't
used in years. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It suddenly gave Fex
an idea. Sooner or later, he would be caught by his family and be
sent back. He knew this was the case, but if he could lighten his
punishment in any way, this might be his chance. If he asked Quinn
about the ability, of course, Quinn wouldn't tell him. All the
families thought the ability had been lost. Looking at Quinn, it was
clear whichever family he worked for were keeping it a secret that
they had found it. Perhaps, trying to overthrow the head family. If
Fex was able to get information from Quinn, how he got this and which
family he belonged to, then perhaps the punishment he would receive
would be lighter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the greed was
starting to grow inside Fex. Observing Quinn's ordeal and the fact
that the ghoul yesterday was in a crazed state, he really needed his
help. Maybe, he could get even more out of this deal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course I
can help you,&quot; Fex said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Those words gave
Quinn hope. The sooner they dealt with Peter's situation, the quicker
they could get on with their lives. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But, I do have
one condition,&quot; Fex said, looking over in the direction of the
two girls. &quot;You see, the one with the golden hair, all I ask for
is some alone time with her.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn turned his
head, he knew straight away who he was talking about - It was Erin.
&quot;Why? Why her? Why can't it be someone else?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn felt that,
perhaps, Fex would need someone to give him a supply of blood while
he was here. Just like Layla was to him. Otherwise, every two days,
he would starve with hunger if Fex was the same type as him. But it
didn't sit well with Quinn that it would be someone he personally
knew. Out of all the people he could have selected, he chose his
acquaintance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you need
blood, I can provide it to you,&quot; Quinn added. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, don't
worry. I have no problem obtaining blood. Although, it would be nice
to have a little blood pet. I promise you that if you just agreed and
let me meet and talk with her, then I'll help you with your little
ghoul situation.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently, the whole
group had finished their combat classes for the day and were inside
Quinn's room. He had just informed them all of what had happened
yesterday when he had rescued Peter. He also included what had
happened at the combat class and what Fex's request was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I hate to
admit it,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;But I kind of agree with Layla on
this one. What is another Vampire doing in the school in the first
place? Is he here because of you Quinn or maybe Peter?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't think
that's the case, honestly he seems to be disinterested in me. He also
said something that he wasn't meant to be here either. I don't know
if he was telling the truth or not, maybe he was trying to get me to
reveal myself.&quot; Quinn felt like pulling out his hair at this
moment, there were so many things running through his head. &quot;I
wish there was like a manual or something on how to be a vampire.
They have so many rules I just don't understand.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The thing is…
I can understand if he wanted you or Peter but why Erin, it doesn't
make any sense?&quot; Vorden shook his head. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the room Erin
had been here the whole time, silently listening away. So far she
hadn't said a single word. As if her mind was someplace else. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That I have no

Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, I have a
question.&quot; Layla said.&quot; How come when you're in the
sunlight you get weak while he doesn't? Is he some kind of special
vampire, because when we left the training hall he seemed to be
walking fine.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn also noticed
that as well, and when looking at Fex closely he noticed a ring on
his finger. He knew instantly that it was the same ring from the
shop. It was a ring that required you to defeat a total of ten
Advanced tier beasts to obtain. It only caused Quinn's worries to
grow, it was clear that even if he didn't ask, none of them were
powerful enough to stop him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the others
were thinking about what to do, Vorden pulled Quinn off to one side
so they could have a private conversation with one another. &quot;Hey
man, not to add to your worries or anything…&quot; Vorden started,
&quot;But I think we got another problem you should know about.&quot;
Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then went on
to explain how a few of Duke's men had come up to Peter in their
training session and how they had asked him to learn the level four
ability by the end of the week. It seemed like everything was
happening at the worst possible timing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then we have
no choice,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;We don't know if Duke is going to
keep a closer eye on Peter or what he plans to do. If we don't get
Peter off this new diet of his as soon as possible then we might have
a serious problem on our hands. If it's out of trusting the Vampire
boy and the Duke, I think right now I trust the Vampire more.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You might be
right about that one,&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;But the problem is
how do we convince Erin?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Vorden
had finished those words Erin stood up straight and had placed her
hand on the hilt of her blade, that was currently sheathed by her
side. &quot;I'll do it, I'll go see this trash,&quot; Erin said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, Erin
you're not thinking straight, he's a vampire, he could be planning to
do the same thing to you, as Quinn did to Peter!&quot; Layla shouted
before pausing. &quot;Oh sorry, I didn't mean that in a bad way.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not afraid
of him, that fool needs to learn his place. He needs to learn not to

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others felt a
little touched. It seemed like Erin had changed, as if she was
fighting for their sake, something that she had never done in the
past. But little did they know, Erin was still the same as always,
when she was talking about blackmail she was talking about her own
situation. She was afraid that if she didn't go through with this,
there was a chance that Fex could tell everyone about what she read. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She regretted giving
him an easy time when the two of them were at the library and now
wished she had taught him a lesson and now this time she would.
&quot;Don't worry I'm confident in my skills, if I was to lose to

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin's stubborn side
had shown and at this point, Layla was the only one trying to
convince her to not go while the boys remained silent. Even Peter
wanted to get this whole thing over with, and if Layla just had to
become a vampire's blood bank, then it was a small price to pay.
Peter had to do worse things than that right now. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think it

and it hadn't rained in a few days so the ground was dry. Quinn stood
there opposite Fex while the others stood just behind the roof door.
The door was slightly open as the four of them peeked to have a look
at what was going on. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin's hand was
twitching as she had it hovered over her sword's hilt. The others had
to do everything in their power to convince her to not go out there
and start a fight straight away. They were interested in what Fex had
to say and if she was to go out with her head full of steam right
now, it would ruin everything. The best option for them was to come
out of this with no fighting. </FONT></FONT>

Vorden was prepared, he currently had an ice ability, a fire ability
and also a slow regenerative ability. While trying to get the ability
it took him longer then he thought, the original person he got it

able to find another student with a similar but weaker version of the
ability. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex had never seen a
vampire break all the rules so casually, there was only one person
who was as daring as him and that was Fex himself. Most vampires were
boring and strict, very traditional in the sense and had been for so
many years, it was why Fex yearned to go to the human world. The more
he was finding out about Quinn the more his interest grew. But with
his position, he could get away with a few things here or there,
while Quinn he had never seen him before, he felt like the more he
stayed around this guy perhaps interesting events would start to
unfold. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin was not at the
level where she could use the ice abilities with just her mind, she
still required small movement with her hands to activate her ability.
She would need to be at least a level 7 ice ability user for that. So
right now she was completely defenceless. Other than her weapon she
had no other piece of beast gear on her, so her strength was that of
a regular person so there was no way for her to break the strings
around her. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What did you
do to me?&quot; Erin asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wanted to
show you what being my puppet actually means,&quot; Fex replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin went to swing
her sword and moved about, yet it seemed like her movements were back
to normal. They weren't slow and everything, so she tried to do what
she could do before. Still, she felt like something was tugging on
the back of her brain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whatever you
did to me, get rid of it now!&quot; She lunged forward and swung down
her sword. However, as she did, Fex moved a single fingertip, and
concurrently, the course of her sword changed, missing the target and
merely swung to the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;My body, did
it just move on its own?&quot; It was a strange feeling for Erin to
suddenly lose control like that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's see what
you got! &quot; Fex shouted. He was now moving his fingers at an
incredibly fast speed, and for every different action that he did, it
would move Erin's body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Erin tried
to resist and fight against the Fex's control, but it felt useless as
if she couldn't do anything. When she soon realised that there was
nothing that could be done, she stopped resisting and just went with
the flow. Doing this, she started to realise something. Fex wasn't
just moving her body about in a random order, but he was actually
performing a certain set of moves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Her swordsmanship
was faster and more skilful than before, and the sound of her strikes
when sliding through the air sounded fast and harsh. While her
movements were soft and flexible as if she was doing a dance, it was
swordsmanship she had never seen before, one that surpassed her own
basic skills that were unrefined. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While doing these
movements, she started to concentrate. She discovered that it wasn't
as if the strings were pulling her along. She could still feel that
her own body was doing all these movements, so it must have been
possible for her to perform these as well. Right now, she was noting
down all the actions she was performing, and when she had gotten the
hang of it, shards of ice would leave the blade as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is Erin
doing?&quot; Layla asked. &quot;I thought she would be attacking him,
but she looks so beautiful.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the ice
surrounding her along with the beautiful skills being shown by Erin,
it was as if they were all watching a performance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't think
it's her look,&quot; Vorden said as he pointed at Fex, who was at the
back, moving his hands and fingers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You are a lot
better than I thought you were going to be.&quot; Said Fex. &quot;It
looks like I was right to choose you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex had seen
enough, he detached the strings that were on Erin, and she suddenly
stopped right there. Her body was no longer being guided by the
strings. Immediately, not wanting to forget the feeling she just had,
she tried performing the same movements. At the start, it seemed to
be going well, but then, the movements just didn't have the same
flair as when she was attached. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She tried again and
again like a person who was possessed, but it was nowhere near the
same level that she was performing before. &quot;You, show me again.
Do what you just did again!&quot; Erin demanded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, now,&quot;
Fex said. &quot;If you started to demand things from me and I
complied without complaints, it wouldn't be very fair, would it? A
relationship should work in two ways.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you don't
want to tell me about it, you know I can just start getting really
nasty.&quot; Lifting her hands, Erin planned to use her ice abilities
this time before he got close to activate his weird puppet thing once
again. But her hands stopped midway as a little tingling feeling
reappeared at the back of her head again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I'm afraid
it's a little too late. You see with the needles implanted in you, I
can reattach my strings to you at any point in time.&quot; Fex
explained. &quot;Now that I have shown you how my swordsmanship
works, it's time that I get something in return.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Walking towards the
lady, step by step, Fex got closer, and right now, there wasn't a
thing she could do to stop him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't take
this anymore. It's not fair on Erin. We forced her into this and it's
clear that she doesn't want to go through with it! What if he's
planning to turn her? I'm going.&quot; Vorden said as he barged
through the roof door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Quinn shouted. They were so close that Quinn didn't want to ruin the
deal they had. So far, he had stayed true to his word and Erin didn't
have a mark on her. He felt like he was so close to solving the
problem with Peter, but after hearing Vorden's words, Quinn released
how selfish he was being. Erin had no reason to be involved in their
affairs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In fact, none of
them here did. Only Peter and Quinn needed to be there, and if he
wanted to solve his own problems, he should have come up with his own
solutions instead of trying to rely on someone else. As soon as he
heard that Fex had a plan, he immediately decided to take the easy
route of asking him rather than trying to brainstorm for an
appropriate method. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's switch
Vorden. I'll teach this guy a lesson. &quot;Raten said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, they're my

</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden ran out,
he gathered a fireball in his hands and was getting ready to throw it
towards Fex. However, just as Vorden was about to let the flames go,
Erin's body had moved and was now right in front of him. She slashed
her sword down and Vorden had to jump out of the way, rolling onto
the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden, that
wasn't me!&quot; She said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How dirty!&quot;
Vorden shouted. &quot;You're going to use her as a shield? Why don't
you fight yourself?!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Erin getting in
between the two, Vorden was unable to use his full strength. At any
point in time, Fex was able to move her to either block the attack or
get in between the two of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, a gust of wind
seemed to go straight past Vorden as he felt his hair rise. When he
looked in front of him, he could see Quinn running past with all his
beast gear on. He had his boots activated and was rushing forward at
full speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like before,
Fex moved Erin in front and commanded her to strike her sword, but
Quinn showed no signs of slowing down, and it looked like he wasn't
even going to bother dodging. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shadow
control!&quot; Just before the sword reached his side, he lifted the
shadow from underneath his foot and blocked the attack, slowing it
down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, using the
flash step, Quinn was able to appear behind Erin and went straight
for Fex. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;

He said as he held up both hands. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his arms
raised, it truly did look like Fex had already surrendered. Not only
that, but Erin was freed from her constraints and could move by
herself again. As soon as she felt the weird connection leave her
body, she had decided to take a few steps back and was now standing
near the door beside Peter and Layla. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on in,
Quinn!&quot; Vorden shouted. &quot;With the two of us, we can easily
take this guy out!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn was
still cautious, having no intentions to let his guard down. He
remembered fighting Fex last time and also saw him go up against Leo.
If Vorden had seen these things, perhaps he wouldn't have been as
confident as he was right now either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There is no
trick.&quot; Said Fex. &quot;You can ask the girl who I have broken
off the connection with. I have done what I wanted to do. All I
wanted was to show the girl what it would be like if she was to
become my puppet. I just presented the power and skills that I would
share with her. And in return, I was going to ask for some blood. Was
I in the wrong?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then pulled
out a flask from one of his trousers' pockets and threw it over to
Fex, who was able to catch it. Fex opened up the lid and could smell
the sweet fragrance emitting from the bottle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If you need
more blood, then you can just come to me,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Just
leave us be and I won't get in your way and obstruct you in your
mission, so you shouldn't get in the way of mine.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex then took a gulp
of blood from the flask as a huge grin slowly made its way to his
face. &quot;Wow, it's pretty fresh, but as I told you before, getting
blood here isn't a problem for me. Look, I didn't want to sour the
relationship between us two. As I have said, this is all a
misunderstanding. Did I ever hurt her?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You took
control of her body and you forced her to attack me,&quot; Vorden
said. &quot;Just get rid of whatever you put into her body. In that
way, you won't be able to control her again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It looks like
I've hit a nerve with one of you. I didn't realise she was already
taken.&quot; Fex said. &quot;As fellow vampires, we should be looking
out for each other. As a sign and the start of our friendship, I
shall do as you ask and remove the needles.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was wondering
why Fex's tune changed so quickly. Before, it seemed as if he was
ignoring him, and now he wanted for the two of them to be friends. It
just didn't make any sense for him. Could he have realised that Quinn
was different from the other vampires? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the real reason
why Fex had changed his mind about the whole thing was because of
Quinn's shadow abilities. He had seen them being used before but
didn't see much of what it could do. During the short confrontation
with Erin, he noticed something about the shadow and how it was
possibly a lot stronger and useful than he thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If he goes
through with the process, are you able to tell me if he does anything
suspicious?&quot; Quinn asked the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not really,
but Erin should be able to tell. When the needles are removed, she
should know.&quot; The system replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group decided to
go through with it, but only if they could stay by Erin's side. At
first, she wanted Fex to use it on her once more to allow her to
experience the feeling and skills he had shown her again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, after being
used to fight against her comrades, she felt disgusted with herself.
She was so weak at that moment and everything had been done against
her will. Even she wanted the needles to be removed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin's back was

holding her hand. Peter, Vorden and Quinn were ready to jump in at
any moment if he was to do something fishy. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The strings were
connected to Erin once more and she felt the tingling sensation at
the back of her mind. Fex then yanked out his hand and at the same
time, all twelve needles that were attached to her body were pulled
out simultaneously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others saw the
needles had been removed and Erin could no longer sense a strange

mine again, then feel free to find me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

plan</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the three boys
followed Fex they couldn't help but wonder what kind of plan he had.
He said he had prepared everything beforehand. Quinn was thinking of
all the possibilities, given how young Fex was and how the system
hadn't recognised him it was clear that the two Vampire minds were a
generation apart. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meaning perhaps
there were some things that had changed that even the system didn't
know about. Maybe in the time period, they were able to find a
substitute for the human flesh? Whatever the plan might have been it
had to be better than letting Peter roam around and kill people. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they followed Fex
they realized that he was leading them back to the student dorms.
Until finally, they had reached a room not too far away from theirs,
located at the end of the hall. It was the last room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I hope you're
hungry,&quot; Fex said as he opened the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as they
entered the room, their jaws had nearly dropped to the floor. Quinn
immediately looked out in the hall to see if anyone had seen them
before closing the door shut. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is the
meaning of this?! &quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Currently on the
floor were seven different students who had been tied up. They each
had a blindfold around their eyes and a piece of cloth gagging their
mouths. Their arms and legs were tied up using the same type of
string that had been used on Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is what
someone should have done before they turned him into a ghoul. I
noticed he was a crazed ghoul so he shouldn't need much human flesh
to evolve. He would need a different type, right? So here you are, I
brought you a different person he can eat for each day of the week.&quot;
Fex explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn realized then
that It wasn't that the system didn't have anyway and Fex did… it
was the fact that they were two different types of vampires. The
system knew that Quinn would never consider this an option so they
would never suggest it </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Fex, even
though he was interested in humans, saw them just as a thing to be
used. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what, you
plan to just kill these students?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;The
school would find out if seven students just went missing, this isn't
really a plan.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, hey now
look who's being the stupid one, no one said anything about killing,&quot;
Fex replied. &quot;The size of meat that a ghoul needs to eat only
needs to be about that of a shoe. So there's no need to kill, no need
for the school to find out.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But won't they
say something happened? If I was them as soon as I left I would get
out of here.&quot; Peter said worried as he saw the students
wriggling about, scared for their lives. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Although you
guys seem to be friends it's like you don't know much about vampires
do you?&quot; Fex shook his head. &quot;If I use my influence powers
then I can make them forget anything ever happened. As for their
missing limbs, I can replace them with a memory saying they lost them
in an accident fighting with each other.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn was
thinking up of different ways to help Peter he too had come up with a
similar option. The only problem was Quinn wasn't confident in his
influence skills. whether it worked or not depended on two things, if
the person he used it on had good mental strength and his charm stats
which were low at the moment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If there was the
chance it didn't work then Quinn would have to kill someone with his
own hands. The killing wasn't the part that Quin didn't like, but
killing someone who had done nothing wrong or no harm to him was
different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These people in the
room were strangers to him and they had families waiting for them
back home, who was he to decide what happened to them. If he was to
abuse his powers then he would be the same as the very people he
hated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, Quinn,
what do you want to do?&quot; Peter asked, looking at him. Peter had
already made up his mind. He was sick of worrying about this and just
wanted to get it over and done with. He convinced himself if he
didn't at least resort to this then there would be more body bags and
a missing limb was better than a body bag. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't,&quot;
Quinn said. &quot;I don't even know these people that well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's reply
surprised Peter, as he was sure Quinn had felt the same way. As if he
just wanted to find the quickest solution. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If it makes it
easier for you some of these people aren't good people.&quot; Fex
then went over to two of the male students off to the right side and
lifted up their head, revealing a few bruise marks on their face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You see these
two here, they were my roommates. As soon as I entered the room they
started ordering me around, I refused and you know what they tried to
do, beat me, so I gave them a beating back. I hadn't even said a word
to them yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about the
rest?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, the rest
were randomly selected, they just had bad luck that's all. Look,
someone had to draw the short straw right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Vorden was
looking at the students he recognized one of the female students. It
was the same girl who he had copied the regenerative ability off the
other day. Now it made sense why he couldn't find her earlier, it
must have been due to Fex keeping her in this room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this though
gave him an idea. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, there
is something we can do?&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden explained how
when he was coming up with plan B he managed to get a list of the
first-year students abilities and what class they belonged to. On
this list, it stated that out of all the first years there were three
students who had regenerative abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before he had never
considered this an option, only now that they were able to erase
their memories did he think of this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There's still
a problem,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Even if we manage to get those
three students we still need two more.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But at least
it's a start, Quinn,&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They explained their
plan to Fex, after all, they needed him to be in on it to make sure
he erased their memories. Although he complained a little he did
accept in the end. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then lifted the
female student of the ground who had the regenerative ability. &quot;I'm
telling you guys, we could get this all over and done with. Are you
sure you want to do it this way?&quot; Fex asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn nodded in

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright then.&quot;
Fex then pushed the female student towards Quinn and he managed to
grab her just before she tripped and fell over. &quot;This is your
problem, not mine, I'm not going to do everything so one of you is
going to have to cut off her body part. I'm not a sicko who gets

talk about which of them should cut off the leg, but none of them
wanted to do it. Vorden knew first hand what the pain was like, and

cut off Vorden's leg. In the end, it was a unanimous decision that
Peter should be the one to do it. </FONT></FONT>

quickly banged a fist on top of the cleaver, pushing it to completely
go through. When the leg was detached, he quickly put it inside a

the wound and raised her leg to cause the blood flow to slow down.

that he didn't sound crazy. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're a

���<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nah, I can

Fex replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A realisation came
over Quinn. If Fex wasn't consuming the blood of every human he came
into contact with, that would suggest that it didn't have the same
effects on him as it did to Quinn. It would be understandable if he
was doing it for reasons to not be caught. However, he already had
these 7 people in the room, yet he didn't consume blood from a single
person. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think you've

to you before, your Vampire powers are unique, different from the

the same can be said the other way round. But this, Quinn, this is
your advantage over the others.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

Erin in the library, then his two roommates, and also Peter and Quinn

left the room, and there was actually no need for him too. The VIP
room had facilities such as a shower and a toilet, and whenever he
wanted, he could call and ask food from the shop to be delivered to
his room. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan greeted them,
&quot;Long time, no see.&quot; As he opened the door for them, they
noticed he still had bags under his eyes. When he finished rubbing
his eyes, he noticed someone else behind Quinn. &quot;It looks like
you brought a friend with you this time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They entered the
room, and Peter couldn't stop looking at all the strange gadgets
inside. He also noticed Logan's watch displayed the number eight,
this frightened him a bit. 'When did Quinn get to know someone so
powerful?' He thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn sat down and
started to explain what he wanted Logan to do. However, this time,
Quinn was afraid Logan might decline. He had already asked so much
from him, and he had nothing to give back in return. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But without
speaking, Logan put on his metallic glove and got to work on the
watch while it was still on Peter's wrist. After a few minutes, he
sat back in his chair. &quot;All done,&quot; He said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now on the watch,
the number two was permanently displayed. &quot;If we want to come
back and increase the number, are you okay with that Logan?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I thought you
might ask something like that, so I already did it for you,&quot;
Logan said. &quot;The numbers will change when you twist the top of
the watch, you can adjust it going from one all the way up to six. So
you will be able to fool anyone into thinking you have a high
ability.&quot; He looked satisfied with himself and added, &quot;I
amaze myself every time I work on something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was feeling
guilty, Logan had helped him out so many times, and he hadn't even
asked any questions. On top of that, he was providing his services
free of charge. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To appease his guilt
Quinn said, &quot;If you ever need any help, Logan, feel free to ask
me any time. I know, there probably isn't much I can do for you, but
even if it's only for testing something in the game, please don't
hesitate to ask, I want to help you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that said, it
was almost time for the combat classes to begin, and the two of them
had to leave. As they left the room, Logan quickly booted up his
computer and started typing away until he suddenly stopped. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If I do this
and he finds out, he will probably never trust me again. It was nice
speaking to a person for once, rather than a machine...&quot; Logan
said. &quot;But at the same time, I can tell you are hiding things
from me, and I can only help you if I know more.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn had first
come to Logan and made his request, he had explained that his system
had hidden the level of his actual ability. So it made sense why he
needed to be able to adjust the score on the watch. When Quinn made
the same request for Peter, it had made Logan secretly happy inside
because he thought that Peter also had a system ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because of this, he
had hoped Peter would be another test subject for him. Even though he
saw Quinn as a friend and was happy to help him, his urge to find out
more about the system far surpassed that of their weak bond. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After touching
Peter, he quickly realized that he didn't have a system ability like
Quinn. He immediately knew because he didn't get the same reaction
from touching Peter that he did from Quinn, it had made him a bit
disappointed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He couldn't think of
a reason why Peter would need to change his level. If it was
something simple like avoiding others from bullying him, it didn't
make sense because it was too risky to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once everyone found
out how weak he was, someone would report him, his watch would get
replaced, and they would keep an eye on him from then on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So he concluded that
Quinn and Peter were hiding something from him. That is when he came
up with the idea to put a recording device inside the wristwatch, so
along with the number modification, he also added the recording
device. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was going to do
this with Quinn, but after he realized they were quickly getting
closer as friends, he decided not to invade his privacy. He enjoyed
their small interactions, and if Quinn found out he wouldn't trust
him anymore, he thought Quinn would eventually tell it to him
himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After they left
Logan, it was time for them to split up, Peter would head to the
elemental class with Vorden while Quinn would head to his beast
weapons class. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In Quinn's class at
the start of the lesson, they continued to practice the kicks that
had been taught the other day. Quinn worked on perfecting them, while
in his head he imagined the feeling of blood swipe going through his
legs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, he would
just have to think about activating the skill and the system would do
the rest for him. But it was only the basic skill that would get
performed. When this happened he could feel the energy moving through
his body, but it wasn't something he did consciously, it happened
automatically. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If he wanted to
combine his blood swipe with his leg techniques he had to recreate
that same feeling in his legs while throwing out a kick, this way he
could consciously move the energy through his body to make variations
in the skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was too bad he
had been too preoccupied to test it yesterday in his free time, Quinn
felt like he was getting the hang of it, but because they were in
class now, he couldn't test it out right now. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While practising, he
noticed that Fex was standing on his own again. Not a single person
had approached to spar with him. It got to the point where Fex was
just lying about and looking at the ceiling in boredom. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo didn't do
anything about students who refused to learn. In his opinion, it was
up to them if they wanted to participate or not. In the end, it was
they who needed to get stronger, not him. However, if one were to
disturb the class he would deal with them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this Quinn
decided to approach Fex. He didn't feel like Fex was a bad person but
more like a child who didn't know how to behave in the human world.
If Quinn could approach him and become closer to him, maybe he could
learn more about the vampires that might be after him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
want to spar?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex got up from the
floor and looked around him, noticing that there was only one person
Quinn could be speaking too Fex said, &quot;Who, me?&quot; While
tilting his head a bit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn nodded. &quot;Maybe
I can use my full strength against you this time?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, right!
But if you insist on an arse-kicking then I'll be happy to give you
one.&quot; Fex replied with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was a good
fighter, and Quinn was hoping to learn from him. If in the future,
they did become his enemies, it would be useful to learn how he
fought, and maybe it would give him some insight into how other
vampires fought as well. Quinn had also gotten a stat boost recently,
and he wanted to see how much of a difference it would make. He knew
he wasn't as powerful as Fex yet, but maybe slowly, as he consumed
more people's blood he could change that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
sparred using the kicking techniques only, and Leo also noticed that
Fex could perform the kicks quite well. It looked like he hadn't been
performing them correctly before just because he didn't feel like it.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, the two of
them knew not to show their true strength or speed otherwise the
others around them would start to get suspicious. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Layla and Erin
were practicing their kicks against each other, Layla noticed Erin
was incredibly distracted, and she was constantly looking over at
where Quinn and Fex were. She was never interested in Quinn before,
even after learning he was a vampire. So it had to mean she was
looking at Fex instead. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After last night
Erin tried to repeat the movements she made while she was under Fex's
control, she tried multiple times, but they just weren't right... She
wanted to feel them one more time. Erin felt like she was close, but
something was just missing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as she looked at
Fex's face, it filled her with disgust. She would never allow herself
to be controlled by another person. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In another training
hall, the elemental class was taking place again. Vorden and Peter
did their usual thing, they kept their distance from each other but
at the same time didn't go too far from each other. The lessons
usually started off with an explanation, then a demonstration, and
afterward, students would try to replicate what they had been taught.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the end of each
lesson, there was always some free time. Students could practice
fighting against each other. Or they could practice on their own,
trying to get the hang of and perfect their skills. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far, the whole
lesson had passed without anything strange happening, and it was only
during the last part of the lesson that the same men that had
approached Peter the other day had approached him once again. Again
they indicated to Peter to move to the back of the class so they
could talk without being overheard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So Peter, I
see you finally reached the level two earth ability, good for you.
But your progress is a little slow, don't you think?&quot; The
student who had approached had quite a skinny frame, and it looked
like he hardly had any fat on him. His face was sunken in, and his
cheekbones were sticking out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was as if fate
had decided from birth how he would look, and had given his parents
the idea for the name they had given to him which was Bones. Although
Bones himself didn't look intimidating, Vorden could see he was
confident when approaching Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking
around, he saw a couple of other students also looking in their
direction. They were probably working for Duke as well. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The Duke wants
to make sure that you progress as fast as possible, and the best way

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Vorden
wasn't close enough to hear what they were saying, he was able to
tell they were in some sort of trouble just from the look on Peter's

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The room was full
with students minding their own business practising their elemental
abilities. Most of them in the room where Earth users, as that was
the most common ability distributed throughout the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was also the
easiest to raise up a few levels ability-wise, but if you wanted to
reach the peak of the earth ability. You were required to join the
military and move up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In one of the
corners of the room, Peter had been taken by Bones, a tall skinny
student who also had two other students by his side. They each formed
a triangle like position, with Bones in front of Peter while the
other two stood behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had his own
fair share fo fighting experiences, and just from looking at this, he
knew what they were planning to do. He quickly needed to think of a
plan and started to look round the room. Otherwise, they were going
to get found out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They couldn't risk
Peter getting taken away now, not while he was still a ghoul, a
single day without flesh would make him go crazy. And although Quinn
believed Peter would remain silent Vorden did not. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright,
Peter, it's time to see what you got.&quot; Bones said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Peter was
far too nervous to hear Bones properly and was thinking about what to
do to get out of this mess. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Why did these guys
have to come and get me now?' Peter thought. 'Is the watch not proof
enough. These guys are they still trying to ruin my life, well, if
I'm going to get caught anyway. I should just kill them.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, Peter
managed to catch Vorden walking up from behind them and then walking
to the side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on,
Peter, are you ready or what!&quot; Bones shouted, as he was starting
to get agitated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had now
stopped off not too far next to them. He started to perform certain
moves, and earth pillars and walls were created as he performed these
moves. It was clear that Vorden had copied quite a high-level earth
ability, but Peter was just wondering what did that have to do with
him? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then he noticed that
Vorden was repeating the same set of moves and then pointing to
himself afterwards. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Does he want me to
copy him?' Peter thought, but just as he was thinking that. He felt a
blunt object hit him in the stomach. When he looked down at what had
hit him, he noticed it was an earth pillar. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't have
all day you little twirp!&quot; Bones shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was surprised
at how little the attack had hurt. It was as if someone had given him
a small nudge, but knowing the others would expect a reaction, he
held his hands around his stomach and started to hurl forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While continuing to
look over at Vorden. Peter then looked at Bones and started to copy
each action Vorden was doing. First was a step on the ground, an
earth wall was then lifted from the floor. Vorden made sure to create
a small one, trying to mimic a level two user. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was only because
he had stolen a level four earth users ability that he was able to
still create earth skills at such a distance. And thankfully, the
others were all distracted, looking at Peter. To the outside, it just
looked like Vorden was practising some form of martial arts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter then threw out
his palm imitating Vorden and the earth wall formed a worm like
shape, still attached to the wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is that enough
for you?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bones then walked up
to the wall and placed his hand on it, lowering the wall down. He
continued to walk forward until he was directly in front of Peter's
face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>An earth pole was
formed into Bone's hand, and he whacked Peter right across the face,
leaving a large red mark. The taste of metal started to fill peters
mouth as blood formed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that point and
time, he had to do everything to stop himself from just jumping on
top of bones and ripping at his neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's for
wasting my time, if you did that in the first place we could have
gone home already.&quot; Bones said as he started to walk off away
from the others. &quot;Peter, make sure you reach level four in time
or else.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the three were
leaving, Peter could do nothing but watch them go, he hated the fact
that even though he now had the chance to fight them, he had to hide
that fact. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, when Peter
looked at the three people just about to leave the training room, he
noticed Vorden was standing in front of them blocking their path. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey guys, it
seems like I have no partner in training today, do you mind helping
me out?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell,
scram out of here!&quot; Bones said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh! You're
happy to practice with me right here and now!&quot; Vorden shouted,
making sure everyone could hear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few seconds later,
and Vorden was already casting his earth spells aiming it at all
three of them. The sudden attacks and Vordens versatile use of the
Earth abilities didn't allow Bones and his men to last long, as
Vorden managed to give each of them a thorough beating without
getting a hit a single time back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once classes were
over for the day. Vorden and Peter met up together in the library.
They each used a book to cover their faces as they talked to each
other using the silencing orb. The orb meant that as long as no one
was at the table, none of the others around them could hear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Okay, so do
you remember the plan?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;Tonight, I want to
try to get all three of those regenerative ability users. There are
three places most likely we can get them. Dinner time after the
canteen, we can follow them, just outside their dorm room, or before
they return to their homeroom classes. All we have to do is convince
each student and lead them to Fex's room to deal with the rest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now this is
important Peter, cause each of us are going to have our own person
we're going to follow. Me, you, and Quinn will each have one person,
so don't mess this up okay?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Peter was
no longer weak like before, Vorden still couldn't rely on him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What about the
two other people?&quot; Peter asked. &quot;If I don't, if I'm not
satisfied after these, then does that mean we're going to have to
kill more?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Peter asked
this, Vorden looked at him carefully. Usually, a person would be
quite worried, but Peter actually said those last words so casually. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Did he change after
killing Earl?' Vorden thought. 'He's getting more dangerous.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stop being
such a hypocrite,&quot; Raten said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden chose to
ignore Raten's words for now. Technically he wasn't being a hypocrite
himself because he had never done such things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We will leave
that to Quinn, I'm sure he will think of something in that time
frame,&quot; Vorden replied </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the two
of them had their targets that they would follow for the day.
However, unknown to both of them, when they thought their
conversation was protected and being kept secret by the sound orb it
actually wasn't. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing what
Peter and Vorden had said, Logan wasn't shocked by it. His mind
worked differently to others. It was very rare for him to feel any
emotion, such as sadness or shock. It wasn't until he first
discovered computers and programming that he started to feel the
emotions of joy and excitement. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So his reaction to
hearing this wasn't normal, to say the least, he felt like he needed
more information before coming to a logical conclusion. So far there
were three students involved, Vorden, Quinn and Peter that he knew
of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The words that stuck
out most to him during the conversation were &quot;kill again&quot;.
Logan then proceeded to log onto his computer and started to access
the school's servers. Whenever he would hit a firewall or a security
breach, he would place his hand on the computer and close his eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please I need
your help, will you let me in?&quot; Logan asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few moments later
and he was into the school system. Since the new school semester
started there were a total of two student deaths that had been
reported, one named Brandon and the other named Earl. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at the
files he also noticed that two students had been brought in for
questioning and one of them for both cases, Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'IF the three of
them are friends are they covering for Peter? Maybe the military was
always close in their investigation but never got the right person.'
Logan thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This seemed to be
the most logical conclusion but then there were still a few things
that didn't make sense. Why would they be covering for a murderer,
they couldn't have been that close as no one knew each other before
coming here. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unless they were
directly involved there would be no need for a cover-up. Then the
second thing was the fact why would there be a need for them to kill
again. The way Peter had spoken had made it sound like an accident. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I decided to
head to the nurse's office, faking that I had a temperature. The two

as the others.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When eating the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The person who
you met today? That's a bad idea.&quot; Vorden replied. &quot;Number
one, did you even see that guy? I think you would have to eat his
whole body to be satisfied. Secondly, he happens to work for Duke.
You're already on his radar. But I think you're along the right line,
we should pick someone who deserves it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And how do we
decide that,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;If anyone deserves it, it would
be Duke himself, everyone is just doing what he says. Peter could
have easily been doing the same thing to others once he went up high
enough up the ladder.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, while in

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There weren't many
people Logan had trusted, and although it wasn't a long time the two
had spent with each other, it felt more special to logan. No one had
ever shown as much interest in what he had worked on. Quinn would
often ask questions about all his gadgets and although he couldn't
appreciate their true worth he could tell he treated them with great

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Logan looked
around the room, he realized that it would be the better option to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three boys had
worked fast this time, and because they were in a rush, even Fex had
to help beyond his determined contribution - An unusual trait of the
young man - for the reason that he was afraid of getting caught.
Rather than simply using his influence skill to clear their minds, he
also commanded them to follow him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, whenever they
arrived at a safe place or a random hall, he would break the skill,
allowing their minds to be cleared. It also returned them to normal
as if nothing had ever happened. The group did the very same thing to
all three students, and they were all fully healed as normal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are we
going to do about the window?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry, I
can deal with that. I will just make the other two students in the
room think that they were in a fight. They can just take the blame.&quot;
Fex said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Fex was
growing a bit tired since he had used his influence skill a lot
today, taking up his mental energy, he merely held out to achieve
their goal. However, he would need a good rest after everything was
over and done with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Should we go
check up on Quinn?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You two can
go, but I don't want to get blasted again,&quot; Fex said as he
looked down, noticing that his wound had finally healed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, the beep
sound of the door was heard. Knowing that it wasn't going to be Fex's
roommates, everybody prepared themselves for the worst to come.
Nevertheless, when they saw Logan enter the room with Quinn trailing
him, they were able to relax a little. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were no
teachers, and Logan no longer looked frightening without him donning
the mech suit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay
guys. Logan knows everything.&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Everything?&quot;
Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They thought that
Quinn had lied, perhaps, or had only told the truth about Peter. But
in reality, Logan knew more than everyone in the room. For Logan now
knew about the system as well as the vampires. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then Pointed
at Peter, and as he spoke to each person, he would move along to the
next. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, I know
that you are a ghoul,&quot; Logan said pointing. &quot;You are a
vampire like Quinn. Also, you're a strange person who seems to be
wrapped up in this, more so than you should be. My conclusion is that
you are crazy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter looked towards
Vorden and could see his eyebrow was twitching up and down. If there
was one word that Vorden didn't like, it was the word crazy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Anyway, I
propose we all head upstairs to my room, for I have a solution to
your little eater problem. Follow me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan left the room
and Quinn followed behind while signalling to the others that it was
alright to do so. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You guys can
go ahead without me,&quot; Fex said. &quot;I've done my part, so
there are no more favours in between us. I did my thing and you did
your thing.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the others left
the room, Fex was finally able to lie down on his bed. The wound and
the strain from the multiple uses of influence skill had drained all
his energy, He didn't follow them because he didn't want to seem weak
in front of the others - Afraid that they might use it as a chance to
get rid of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll just go
ahead and close my eyes,&quot; Fex said as he nearly instantly went
to sleep. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The boys, except for
Fex, had finally made it into Logan's room and made sure that the
door was firmly shut behind them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you sure
this isn't all a trap, Quinn? How is this guy meant to help us.&quot;
Vorden whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know,&quot;
Quinn replied. &quot;He hasn't told me anything yet, but I trust him.
He helped me out with the watch and knew about my shadow abilities,
yet still didn't tell anyone. I see no reason for him to tell others
about this as well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then logged-in
to his computer as usual. From the surface of the computer screen, a
light shone out and a projection appeared, allowing the others to see
everything that Logan was doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The problem is
that you need a fresh piece of human meat, correct? But the human
meat shouldn't be rotten, so going to the cemetery is not an option.
You also couldn't sneak into the hospital due to the surveillance
cameras.&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then went onto a
certain site. It looked exactly like the marketplace that Quinn had
gone on to buy his equipment, only this was slightly different.
Instead of a white background on the webpage, it was black. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I will
introduce you to a whole new world you probably didn't even know
existed.&quot; Said Logan &quot;We call this the Dark Market place.
It contains items that aren't allowed to be sold on the regular
market place. It even has a request board, one that can evade the
eyes of the government.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What kind of
things are on there?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sometimes,
they will ask someone to steal information from their competitors.
Some jobs even include hiring assassins to hit on certain people all
around the world. Usually, if there is something that you want to
get, you can find it here.&quot; Said Logan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I've heard of
this before,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;But I had no clue how to access
it. It seems like only certain people within a group know how to. My
family said they would let me know once I am old enough.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's because
the Dark Marketplace only allows certain individuals to get a
membership. However, my ability allows me to bypass any restrictions,
and I am able to log in with no worries.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan then typed
into the search bar and straight away, what they were looking for
appeared. The words could clearly be seen &quot;Fresh human flesh
available now - Cut less than 24 hours ago.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this scared
the others a little. They were still young and naive. They knew the
world had taken a turn for the worse, yet this seemed like a few
steps too far. But even in the past, in the old age of the internet,
there was a similar service like this called the Dark web. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this, Quinn
started to read the description and found something strange. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The item has been
shrunk, wrapped, and filled with nitrogen to keep it as fresh as
possible. It had also been dried of all blood, so the customer can
only get the flesh itself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Logan, could
you check for me? Is there any way to get blood?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The others thought
that Quinn perhaps didn't want to rely on Layla or Vorden any longer.
If he could get an endless supply online, that would be a big help
for him. However, Quinn was actually hoping for a shortcut, but
seeing the fact that the human flesh had been dried of blood made him
feel a little suspicious on the ensuing transaction. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan did a quick
type, and to his surprise, the screen said: &quot;No results found.&quot;
This was the Dark market place, as long as there was a demand for
something, then they would have it. Yet this time, they didn't have
blood? It was certainly strange. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I find it odd
that there wouldn't be blood on this. Regardless, even before
vampires began to exist, there are underground hospitals and groups
who would need it for emergency situations. Perhaps I should look
into this more.&quot; Logan continued to ponder on the subject. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, are we
able to order the flesh then,&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ah yes, I'll
do that for you now,&quot; Logan replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The flesh cost quite
a sum - It was around 10,000 credits, the same price as an advanced
tier beast core. However, Logan had covered the cost of the flesh for
them. He stated that he would much rather let himself do this than
allowing them to go around the school, trying to cut someone's limb
off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although this was
bad in its own way, the flesh already existed on the market place.
The person was dead and there was nothing they could do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once he placed the
order online, just like the marketplace, he had received a code. When
the confirmation was sent, he was ready to receive his package. In
his own room, Logan had a teleporter receiver for packages. He often
ordered things online and on the Dark market place for parts for his
gadgets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After typing the
code in, the item suddenly appeared in a box. They opened it up and
it was shrunk, wrapped, and covered with ice, just like the order had
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn used his
inspect skill. Thereafter, the description stated that there wasn't a
single part of it which had blood on them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After taking it out,
they placed the meat on Peter's hands, and Logan couldn't stop
staring at him. He was interested in seeing how Peter was able to eat
the meat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Peter was a
little shy, he quickly gobbled up the food quickly. When he saw that
it was similar to an animal eating meat, Logan lost his interest once
again. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Almost at the same
time as Quinn had received the notification from the system, a loud
groan could be heard from behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter what's
wrong, are you okay?&quot; Vorden said, with a worried expression. He
was shaking Peter who had fallen, and was lying on the ground. Peter
was clutching his belly with both hands, he felt like a fire was
spreading out from that point all over his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Guys! Give him
some space!&quot; Quinn said, &quot;He's evolving! I don't know what
he'll turn into, or what's going to happen to him next.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn knew from his
own experience how painful the process of evolving was, but more than
that, he was worried what Peter might turn into. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had
immediately asked the system what Peter would evolve into, but the
response he received worried him. The system said that there were
many possibilities and it couldn't predict which one Peter would
evolve into. He had thought that by completing his quest and letting
Peter evolve, it would be the end of his problems, but once again,
the system had kept some information from him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When lower class
creatures like ghouls evolved, there were many different classes they
could change into. Sometimes, by using certain methods, the classes
someone would evolve into could be influenced, but mostly it was a
random process which depended on the situation and personality of the
individual. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every class had its
own set of skills, and some were rarer than others. But when Quinn
found out about a specific class a ghoul could evolve into, he became
very upset, it was the class known as the wendigo. Out of all the
classes Peter could evolve into, this was the worst. It was the only
class that would still require him to eat human flesh, but that was
not the only issue with the class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The system had added
that because they managed to feed Peter quickly, it wasn't likely he
would turn into a wendigo, but there were no guarantees. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of them stepped
back, to give Peter some space. Logan turned his spider-bots into a
cannon attached to his arm, and aimed it at Peter. He hadn't covered
his whole body this time, but just enough to create the cannon. Logan
looked at the others with a determined look on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not taking
any chances,&quot; Logan said, &quot;There are too many things left
in this world that I still need to discover and investigate.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden totally
agreed with him, and thought his actions were very reasonable. He was
glad Logan had something to point at Peter, because he only had the
healing ability right now, and that wasn't any help if things went
wrong with the evolution. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The groans coming
from Peter were getting louder, and he started to shake all over.
This much pain he had never experienced before, it felt like
something was trying to break all the bones in his body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they nervously
watched Peter, they started to see visible changes to his body. His
skin began to shrink and tighten, and turning white all over. He
didn't look sick or weak, the scene actually reminded Vorden of what
Quinn had looked like before his evolution into a full vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It looked like
Peter's body hadn't lost any body mass, but it looked like he was
shrivelling up and was dehydrated. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, he's not
turning into a wendigo is he?&quot; Quinn asked the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm don't know
for sure, but you should be prepared for the worst. I'll be honest
with you, these are the signs of someone turning into one. If that's
the case, I think it would be best to allow Logan to just kill
Peter.&quot; the system replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But I thought
you said it was impossible for me to kill Peter? Also, why can't we
just feed him again till he evolves, like last time?&quot; Quinn
asked, with a mix of fear and hope in his voice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For your first
question, as long as it is someone else who is going to kill Peter,
and you don't try to abandon him at that moment, anyone can kill him.
Secondly, unlike other classes, wendigo's can't evolve anymore, and
unlike a ghoul, they aren't loyal to their master at all. They have
lost their intelligence entirely, and can only react based on
instinct, they have only one thing on their mind, which is food. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The only bit
of loyalty they have left is that they won't attack their master, but
for the rest of their undead lives they will continue to hunt and
kill humans to eat their flesh.&quot; the system replied, dashing
Quinn's hope. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't like
the idea of it, but if Peter turned into a wendigo, he had no other
choice. Too many people had already gotten hurt. He had felt guilty
about Peter's situation, which was why he was doing his best to help
him, but this was a cost that would be too high even for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the same time,
there was something that was worrying Peter a lot more right now, his
heartbeat was starting to slow down, with the pain on top of this he
thought perhaps he was dying. However, even though his heart wasn't
beating anymore, he could still feel everything, and it didn't feel
like he was dead at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then finally, his
heartbeat had stopped entirely and at the same time, so did the pain.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter stood up
from the floor, his face looked more sunken in than before, and his
skin was slightly paler. Immediately Peter grabbed his chest for some
reason, and he held it there for a while, yet there was nothing, not
a single beat was felt. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Tell us your

that Peter was right in the head. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't answer

He said, pointing at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

When Quinn noticed this he immediately intervened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter stop
that!&quot; For some reason, it felt natural and instinctive to Quinn
to do this. It was like he was telling off a bad dog for growling at
another person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the meantime,
Logan had removed Peter's wristwatch and had made a few adjustments
using his glove before handing it back to Peter, who put it back on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter had become a
lot less talkative, and at the same time, it seemed like he wasn't as
timid before. It was causing a strange atmosphere in the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter why
don't you come stand over by my side,&quot; Quinn said, noticing how
everyone was feeling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter then walked
over to where Quinn as, while constantly looking around the room, as
if he was checking it out for any dangers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When you asked
me to make adjustments to Peter's wristwatch, I planted a listening
device inside. I felt like you were hiding something, so I thought
this was the best course of action,&quot; Logan replied to Vorden's
question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing this
from Logan, Quinn felt like he had no right to be upset with him. He
really was hiding things from him, and even now Quinn still hadn't
told him everything, &quot;It's okay, but Logan are we still
friends?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We're
friends?&quot; Logan replied with a confused look on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course,
friends help each other out, and you've helped me more than ever,&quot;
Quinn explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, if
that's the case this seems to be a one way friendship, since you
haven't helped out with anything yet, at all!&quot; Logan replied,
bluntly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Logan
sounded rude, he wasn't. Logan had always been honest like this, and
he wasn't really good with human feelings and emotions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the three boys
were leaving Logan's room, Quinn stopped by the door, and pointed at
the briefcase he had looked at before when he was with Logan. &quot;You're
right,&quot; Quinn said, &quot;I really haven't helped you even when
you helped me out so much. You know that briefcase I almost touched
before, well my system says it was made by Richard Eno.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that piece of
information, Logan's thoughts were confirmed, he knew it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You are still
my friend Quinn!&quot; Logan shouted as the door shut behind them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The biggest worry
looming over their heads had finally disappeared, but that didn't
mean they were completely in the clear. While Vorden and Peter were
going back to their dorm room, Quinn decided he would go pay the
girls a visit, and update them on the situation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They both knew what
the plan was for today, although Layla was happy to help, Erin didn't
want to be anywhere near Fex. Vorden had strongly agreed with this as
well. So Layla and Erin had agreed to stay out of it for the most
part, and allowed the others to help Peter out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Boys weren't allowed
in the girl's dorm rooms, and although the military staff usually
weren't very strict on this rule, it was currently night time and it
would be curfew soon, so Quinn was a bit worried that anyone would
see him. After he knocked on their door, he spoke through the door to
confirm it was him, and the three of them then went for a walk down
the hallway while Quinn explained everything that happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So he won't
have to eat humans anymore, and there is no need to get involved with
that Fex kid again? Good!&quot; Erin said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing
everything that happened it seemed like they were able to solve
Peter's problem with ease, and thanks to the dark market place if
another ghoul was created they would be able to solve that problem a
lot easier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Should I experiment
with myself first before telling the others?' Layla thought. 'Just
maybe…if I get strong enough, I can break free.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, after Quinn
had told them everything, Layla could tell that something else was on
his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's wrong
is there another problem?&quot; she asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then proceeded
to tell them the situation with Duke, how for some reason, they
desperately wanted Peter to learn the level four earth ability by the
end of the week. The major problem was Peter didn't have an earth
ability and he was too involved in all of it to cut ties. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, did you
say by the end of this week, that's this Sunday right?&quot; Layla
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, that's
what Peter told us,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla was visibly
shaken after she heard this news, but she forced her facial
expression to remain neutral. The message she had received from one
of the Pure agents, was Truedream would be coming at the end of the
week. On the same day, by which they wanted Peter to learn the
ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the others found
out Truedream was coming over, they wouldn't find it a big deal. For
he had close ties to the military and would often visit the military
bases. But Layla knew the truth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One of Pure group's
biggest targets was Truedream, he was the whole reason why the
military was able to keep such a strong grip on everyone. Of course,
the reason why he was coming was to take students abilities form
them, to give them to his own men. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And Peter had been
selected as one of the Targets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finishing
their talk, the group decided to split up with each other and head
for their own rooms for the night. When Quinn opened the door, he was
surprised to see Vorden rushing over to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn, thank
heavens your back!&quot; Vorden said. &quot;It's Peter, he's become a
weirdo, and he's just standing above his bed, and he won't listen to
anything I say. I was trying to relax, and listen to some music, but
I can't with him just standing there staring. What the hell happened
to him?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
laugh nervously, it looked like Peter had changed more than he
thought. &quot;Peter you can rest, why don't you lie on the bed.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter did as he was
asked but when lying on the bed they noticed he didn't close his
eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System what's
up with him? &quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry he
just recently changed, you have to think of him as a new-born person,
he will soon start to do things on his own more often but now that he
is an undead, he will no longer require any sleep.&quot; The system
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this made
Quinn a little upset, the old fragile scared Peter had completely
disappeared and was no longer there. Even though Quinn had saved him,
he wasn't sure if he really had, it seemed like Peter was an entirely
different person now, and he didn't even know who he was looking at
anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the girl's
room, Layla was also having trouble sleeping, there were three days
before Truedream would arrive on campus. Which meant she had three
days to try and figure out a way how to tell the others what was
going to happen to Peter, without revealing who she really was. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The morning sun had
finally risen, a few people around the school had struggled to sleep
through the night, and Layla was one of them. Throughout the whole
night she had been pondering how to inform the others. She had
already made up her mind that she needed to warn them, but couldn't
figure out how. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She didn't want to
imagine what would happen when Truedream found out that Peter had no
ability that could be taken. She was aware of his intentions, from
what the boys and Pure had told her, Layla had accurately deduced the
specifics of Duke's plan. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every term,
Truedream would visit a different military base. However, it turned
out that he visited a particular one more often than the others, and
that was military base two. This was the reason why Layla had been
sent to this place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Something strange
was going on with military base two, they hadn't been able to figure
out what yet, because so far every agent they sent had disappeared.
Thus, they decided to do things differently this time, so instead of
sending a grownup, they decided to send an agent, who was at the age
of the draft, in as a student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason for
Truedream's visit was to acquire different abilities from students.
Every time that Truedream used his ability, it would also increase
his ability level along with it. His skill bypassed almost all the
information that they had about mutant cells. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After taking
someone's ability away, he could then implant the ability into a new
person. Their body would automatically get the same ability level as
the one that was taken. Nevertheless, they would still need to take
the time to get familiar with the ability and learn all the skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was why they
were offering Peter a lot of ability books, and it also explained why
they were hurrying him to get his ability to level four. There were
always certain criteria when it came to choosing which students to
use for this. The first and most important criterion was, they should
never hail from an original family. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Truedream's
family was one of the big four, usually other originals were also
part of the big four, or under the banner of one. So this criterion
was added to avoid a war between the big four. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They needed students
who wouldn't stand out, so that people wouldn't really notice, or
care if they were to go missing. As such another one of the criterion
was, the student had to come from a poor family, ones with no backing
or support. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was still safe
because the school believed that at present he had no ability, but
both Layla and Peter's abilities were documented, and both of them
fulfilled the criteria. It was different for them, there was a
possibility that along with Peter, Layla was also a target. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had entered
the school using false documents, her family wasn't prominent, but
she didn't mind if she was to lose her ability. She had only obtained
it for the mission in the first place. The only thing that she didn't
want was to end up like Peter, and be the military's lap dog. She
needed an outside position, where she could observe everything that
was happening without getting involved. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With all things

wanted to. The question left was, how should she go about explaining
what she had discovered? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately,
before she could even reach Quinn, he had already gone off to Fex.
Although the two of them didn't talk much, she could see that Quinn
was enjoying himself while practising with Fex. Perhaps, it was
because they were both the same race or had something else in common.

to continue practising these stupid leg techniques. This is the beast
weapons class, not the martial arts class. And Leo said he wouldn't
move on until he was satisfied with the performance of every single
one of us,&quot; She complained, with a slight look of frustration on

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's wrong?
We have practised that kick so many times, I was sure you would be
able to block something like that?&quot; Erin said as she walked
over, and offered her hand to her fallen comrade. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla lifted her
hand to grab Erin's, but the pain on her side hurt even more.
Furthermore, she noticed a stinging pain arise every time she
breathed. &quot;What the hell? I knew your sword skills were
monstrous, but where did you get such strength in your kicks? I think
you broke one of my ribs.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Would you stop
complaining?&quot; Erin said as she knelt down, and placed her hand
on her friend's side. She then activated her ice ability, ever so
slightly, causing the muscles around that area to become numb from
the cold, and also taking the pain away. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin then lifted
Layla up from the ground, allowing her to use her shoulder for
support. &quot;Don't worry, I will take her. Besides, she needs to
walk a little bit on her own. It will only make her stronger,&quot;
Erin said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two girls then
started to leave the room together. As they were walking, Layla
couldn't help but feel useless and pathetic. Other than a blood bank
for Quinn, what use did Layla really have? She hadn't even been
helpful in the fight with the Dalki. If it wasn't for Erin, the two
of them would have been dead back then. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And Vorden, although
a bit messed up in the head, was very powerful. The only one who was
even more worthless than her was Peter, and that wasn't much of an
achievement. </FONT></FONT>

block something like that,&quot; Erin said, in an attempt to comfort
Layla. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla didn't even
notice, since her thoughts were so muddled that tears were now slowly
descending from her eyes. She wiped them away, and simply put on a
brave smile. </FONT></FONT>

we're in a fight,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, you're

sounded. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Erin was
right, it still hurt Layla to hear it straight from her mouth. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But you help
in other ways. You were the one who thought about that blood bowl,
remember? I can't say much, but honestly, if you weren't there to
hold me back sometimes, I would have already shoved a few spikes up
the boy's backsides.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back at the training
hall, the lesson had just finished for the day. Quinn had managed to
work up quite a sweat all the while going up against Fex. Truth to be
told, Fex was the only person in the room who he could go against
while merely using a fraction of his power, outside of Leo of course.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When practising with
Layla and Erin, he would always have to hold back his power slightly,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now that the lesson
was over for the day, students were free to do what they wanted.
That's the moment when Quinn noticed Fex, who was looking around the
room oddly, and was kicking the floor about, until he eventually
started to speak up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, uh… I
know this is kind of strange to ask after everything that happened
between us, but what are you planning to do after this?&quot; Fex
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lately, whenever Fex
would try to approach people, they would turn away as soon as they
saw his watch. It was a strange reaction, but he had finally
understood the matter when he saw the mistreatment going on around
the school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This caused him to
be quite an outcast, yet that wasn't the only problem. He was also
incredibly bored. With no one to really talk to, and nothing to
explore, he started to look forward to the training sessions with
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Me, umm, I was

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two boys had
finished their combat classes for the day and decided that they would
head to the VR room together. Fex was casually standing outside in
the sun, and Quinn could see it didn't affect him at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn had to
prepare his trusty umbrella, and opened it up before stepping into
the sun. It was a strange action, but not so strange that it
attracted the attention of others. Earth had gotten hotter over the
years and there were quite a few people who wished to protect their
skin with the use of UV umbrellas, and on a hot day like today, no
one would bat an eye at what Quinn was doing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing this Fex
looked oddly at Quinn, he had only seen a vampire use such things in
really old books, he couldn't help but giggle at the thought that
Quinn looked like an old man. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
doing with that old thing?&quot; Fex asked. &quot;Don't you have a
ring?&quot; He lifted his hand showing the small ring he was wearing,
Quinn was now close enough to see that it really did look like the
one in his shop. Using his inspect skill it confirmed the fact that
it was indeed the very same ring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't know
how to reply to Fex, the system had informed him that these rings
were the bare basics for vampires, and it seemed like if he didn't to
come up with something, it would reveal him even sooner. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But while Quinn was
trying to come up with a lie to tell him, Fex was the one who once
again came up with his own explanation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I see
now...&quot; Fex said. &quot;You really are one of those vampires
raised here on earth aren't you? Trained to blend in and report back.
I guess that's why you didn't go through the formal initiation, and
why you don't have one of these.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex said those
words something had caught his attention. The fact that Fex had said:
&quot;one of the vampires on earth&quot;. Did this mean vampires came
from another planet? Were vampires some sort of alien too? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;System do you
have an explanation for this, are vampires aliens?&quot; Quinn asked.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm afraid I'm
just as confused as you are, as far as I know, vampires have always
existed on earth, alongside humans. I'm afraid I don't know how much
time has passed since your family has been in possession of the book,
so a lot could have changed since then.&quot; The system replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at Fex, it
seemed he was showing off his ring quite proudly, and that's when
Quinn remembered the requirements to get the ring. It was to kill 10
Death bats, an advanced type of beast. This brought back memories for
Quinn on how hard it was for him to defeat an intermediate beast. He
couldn't even imagine how hard it would be to defeat and kill an
advanced tier beast or the many higher classes above them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Was the
initiation hard?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex started to laugh
nervously at this question. &quot;Was it hard? Of course it was hard!
Yet I was one of the youngest vampires to ever complete it.&quot; As
he said this he raised his chest up a bit to make himself look a
little bigger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The vampire
continued, &quot;You see the initiation is getting the materials for
the ring itself. A young vampire must go out and slay ten Death bats.
Once you earn this ring you are no longer required to go through
regular school training with all the rest, but it seems I just jumped
from one training school into another.&quot; Fex finished, a little
depressed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't know
why, but he could tell that Fex was slightly nervous when answering
his question. What helped Quinn to notices this was that Fex was the
type whose feelings and emotions were easy to read, he was like an
open book, every emotion he had was displayed on his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, this
conversation reminded Quinn about how he had to be cautious around
Fex. Although the two of them seemed to be on friendly terms, he
still couldn't trust him, and he didn't know what his goal here at
the school was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fact that he
managed to kill ten advanced tier beasts, was a big reminder of the
difference between their two strengths, even if Quinn had a way of
getting stronger, he wasn't on the same level as Fex yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As they continued to
walk to the VR centre, Fex looked at his ring and felt a little
guilty. He had lied to Quinn just now. He hadn't earned the ring like
he said he did. Fex had hoped to become one of the youngest vampires
to ever complete the initiation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had gone out and
travelled and fought against the death bat, but after a gruesome
fight, and a near death experience with the first one, Fex only
barely managed to come out on top. He thought with him being the top
of his class he was ready, but it had turned out that wasn't the
case. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He felt embarrassed,
because before he had left his school classes, he had told everyone
how easy it would be for him to achieve such a task. If they were to
find out he only managed to defeat one before giving up, he would
become a laughing stock. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So to make sure he
wouldn't get laughed at, he went on the market place and hired some
travellers to hunt the beasts for him. This was working out for him,
and he almost had enough crystals for the ring, but the last
traveller that accepted the contract never replied back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, it was
all thanks to Blood Evolver who placed the crystal he needed on the
market place, so that he was finally able to craft the ring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had eventually
arrived at the VR room, and it was a sight that Fex had never seen
before, although he wasn't that amazed because it just looked like a
room full of sleeping capsules. Judging by his reaction, Quinn could
tell Fex had no idea what these were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry, I
was confused when I came here for the first time as well. Just follow
me and I'll let you know about the basics.&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They went to the
counter and Quinn paid for both of them to play in the capsules for a
few hours. Quinn still had plenty of money left from the crystals he
had sold earlier. On top of that he also still had nine crystals from
the last outing which hadn't been used to create the suit that he
could sell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey I have my
own money you know, you didn't have to pay for me?&quot; Fex said,
displaying his golden card. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,&quot;
Quinn said gritting his teeth not realizing his mistake. If he knew
Fex had money he wouldn't have paid for him, he wasn't some charity
worker, and right now he wanted to save up every credit he had. It
was only with the goal of finding out more about vampires that Quinn
was being so nice to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He didn't think
vampires would have much money, after all, how would they obtain it
when they were hiding all the time. Instead, it looked like Fex was
some spoiled rich kid, the way he was waving the gold card around

the favour</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex carefully looked
at each letter of the words in front of him. He needed to make sure
what he was seeing was real, because he couldn't believe it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Blood Evolver, no
it can't be?' Fex thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking at the
name he realised it was the same user ID that was also used in the
market place when he had bought the beast crystal. However, it was
quite common for people to use the same user ID's when logging into
different websites and games. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What were the
chances of someone else having the same user ID, and also being a
vampire? Fex had found it strange in the first place that someone had
been selling the crystal. The planet where the Death Bats can be
found is rarely visited by travellers, so their crystals are very
rare on the market place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was one of the
reasons why the Vampires had decided to use it as their training
ground. An added benefit was the fact that their crystals could be
used to create the ring. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex first saw
the crystal, he thought maybe someone had killed a Death Bat along
the way, someone who didn't know what to do with it, and chose to
sell it after finding out it could only be used to create a silly
ring. After all, it had no effect on humans. Not even a little buff
in strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now thinking
about it more, all sorts of questions started running through his
head. If Quinn really was the same person, what was he doing on that
planet, and how did he get his hands on a Death Bat crystal? Fex knew
his strength, and he wasn't strong enough to beat one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And even if he was,
why wouldn't he keep the crystal for himself, and make a ring of his
own instead of using that silly umbrella? Nothing was making sense in
his head right now, and thinking about it was starting to make it
hurt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He accepted the
friend request, and immediately Quinn was transported to the same
white space that Fex was in as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Foxy Fex?&quot;
Quinn said, looking at his user name. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, you
don't like it?&quot; Fex said. &quot;Better than Blood Evolver, what
are you trying to do, tell everyone out there you're a vampire?&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn laughed
nervously back. &quot;I thought it would be vague enough, plus who
else but other vampires would think that,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the
confirmation Fex needed. No other vampire out there would be silly
enough to have a name such as Blood Evolver. The name was a little
bit childish and Quinn kind of fit that image. A naive young vampire.
Although Fex couldn't talk much himself. In Fex's eyes this only
added to the mystery of Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, it didn't
change the fact that thanks to Quinn selling the crystal, Fex was
finally able to leave his home, and enjoy the outside world. So far
his experiences hadn't been great, but it was something different,
and he was slowly learning to enjoy it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't the same
boring old routine he would practice day after day, and Fex wanted to
thank Quinn for that in some way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While standing there
and thinking about everything. Fex could see Quinn using his blood
skills in the game. Not only that, but he was able to use them
constantly without getting tired. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is
that?!&quot; Fex asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then explained
how while in the lobby of the game, they were able to practice using
their vampire skills without tiring out. But once they were in the
game, then their normal body limits would be put on them as usual. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't explain
that while in the game the HP reducing when using blood skills didn't
happen, but because the system had said only his vampire skills were
linked to a system, and other vampires probably didn't know about HP,
he thought it would be hard to explain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After trying out a
few skills here and there, Fex had a big grin on his face. He then
started performing his martial arts while mixing in the blood skills
here in there. The main skills he used were blood swipe and blood
spray. But once in a while, he would use skills that Quinn had never
seen before, such as the blood wall and a few others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, what had
impressed Quinn the most while watching him practice, was the martial
arts he was using with his fists. They were fast and compact, and he
could tell it definitely increased the efficiency of something like
blood spray. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Fex had
stopped, he walked over to Quinn with a hop in his step. &quot;Hey
man, this is great! I wonder why the vampires don't have a bunch of
these in their buildings. It could really help the kids train.
Although, I guess if they get too used to the game, then it wouldn't
help them out that much in a real battle but still this is great!&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Fex was
yammering away, he noticed that Quinn was staring at the blank empty
space where Fex was standing. He started waving his hand in front of
Quinn to see if he was still there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hello?&quot;
Fex said, still waving his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot;
Quinn replied. &quot;I was just looking at your martial arts.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh yeah,
that's right, you didn't learn any did you since you grew up here and
everything.&quot; Fex then started to think if there was something he
could do. Then something popped in his head an idea. &quot;You know I
can teach you the martial arts if you want?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex thought this was
a great idea. He wanted to repay Quinn for getting him the beats
crystal he needed, and this could be his way of returning the favour
secretly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Really, would
that be okay?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why not,
you're a vampire, so you have the right to learn it.&quot; Fex said
enthusiastically. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex then got into a
fighting stance and tried to show all the motions to his attacks
while explaining them, &quot;So for the first step you want to look
like this, then you're going to feel a burning energy rise up. Next
with your hands, you need to go: POW POW POW,&quot; Fex said as he
made each move, &quot;Did you get all that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Um, kind
of..?&quot; Quinn started copying what Fex had done, but it didn't
seem to be working out at all and even Fex realised this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry, I
guess I'm not really the teacher type. I'm not that good at
explaining things.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay,&quot;
Quinn replied, but Fex could tell Quinn was a little down when saying
this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a lightning
bolt idea had hit him. &quot;Hey, there is something I can do.
Although I can't show you or teach you through words, I could move
your body.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you
remember what I did to your friend on the roof? Well if you let me do
the same to you, then I can show you how to use the martial arts. My
string puppet is unique, so when you perform it, it will feel like
I'm actually performing the skills through your body.&quot; Fex
explained. &quot;Not only that, but it should allow you to memorize
everything through your own body. In a way, this will be a short cut,
and you will learn it far quicker.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Fex was

something new</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're
worried, aren't you?&quot; Fex asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Judging by how long
Quinn had remained silent, Fex could tell that he was in deep thought
about whether to trust him or not. And Fex really couldn't blame him,
if he was in Quinn's situation he would have done the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are there any
risks to this?&quot; Quinn asked the system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After losing to Fex
in battle so easily, and seeing him go toe to toe with Leo. He felt
like learning the military martial art of the vampires would put him
at a big advantage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think you
should go for it,&quot; The system replied. &quot;In terms of other
vampires, you're a bit weak and on the wimpy side. I think this would
be major progress for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know that!&quot;
Quinn snapped back, a little annoyed at the system's words. He knew
he was weak, but the system didn't have to remind him every time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm talking
about him taking control of me, what happens if it becomes
permanent?&quot; Quinn asked the system seriously. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It won't be,
vampires can't have other vampires as their puppets permanently. It
was why he was so interested in your friend. If you want to remove
the strings, you can forcibly cut though them. Although, it may take
some time depending on your strength, and it will cause extreme
pain.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So there is
the possibility he could use me to hurt those around me, even for a
short period of time if he wanted to?&quot; Quinn continued his line
of questioning. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was when Quinn
came up with an idea of his own. While in the normal gaming pods,
both his and Fex's ability weren't selectable. That was because these
abilities seemed to be unique to vampires. However, it was different
when using Logan's pod. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With Logan's pod, he
was able to program and record abilities, and perhaps find a way so
the two of them could link up and use their abilities together. This
would solve his problem, and as an added benefit, he wouldn't get
tired inside the game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the game,
there was no danger of Fex permanently controlling Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me think
about it for now,&quot; Quinn replied. &quot;Why don't I show you how
to play the game first?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then showed
him the basics of how to use the game's interface. He also explained
the matchmaking system and the process to select an ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex was pretty upset
when he found out he wasn't able to use his strings-ability in-game,
but his mood quickly changed when he realised he was able to
customise his in-game avatar according to his preferences. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex designed his
character in full-black clothing. He looked like an ancient ninja
with a face mask and hood, only allowing his eyes to be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He spent more time
customizing his character then he did anything else, and he had
already used his money card to buy a few extra items of clothing to
get the full set. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When comparing their
avatars, Quinn's now looked incredibly plain. Since he was only able
to use the free items that were available to everyone. He could spend
the money he had, but he still remembered how he was struggling even
getting ten credits not too long ago. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, it was time
for them to search for opponents. While doing so, Quinn went for the
'Quick Selection' option since he no longer gained Exp from low
levels. The opponent would at least need to be at level three for him
to gain any Exp. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A match had been
confirmed and Fex was transported to the seating area in the arena.
He could see Quinn standing on one end while his opponent stood on
the other. His opponent was skinny, tall, and seemed to be resembling
a tree. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What surprised him
though was the fact that when he sat down in the seating area, he
wasn't the only one watching Quinn's fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, you're
new,&quot; Nate said, looking at Fex. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What is all
this?&quot; Fex asked, looking confused. &quot;Is everyone here to
see the two of them fight? His opponent must be pretty special.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked at the
stand, noticing the crowd that had formed. There were fifty people in
total, all avatars dressed up in different ways. Judging by what
Quinn had said about the game, this was optional. Meaning, all the
people that had appeared to watch had chosen to do so of their own
volition. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course, it
seems like Blood Evolver has gained quite a following,&quot; Nate
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since the last fight
between Quinn and the level four user, people had become fans of him.
They added him to their watch list, so they would be notified
whenever Blood Evolver was online. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Originally, most of
them were watching Quinn's matches for different reasons. He was
known as a hacker, someone who was able to use abilities not
programmed into the game. No one knew how he was able to do this. But
it was clear by now nobody cared anymore. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After witnessing his
stellar performance in the previous match, they had quickly forgotten
about everything else, and solely wanted to watch all of the Blood
Evolvers upcoming fights. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate had watched all
the fights of Quinn so far. So, he recognised the regulars and the
irregulars, which was why he was able to spot Fex right away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, are you
implying that all these people are here to see Blood Evolver?&quot;
Fex asked,&quot; with a little surprise showing on his face, &quot;What
makes him so special?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nate thought about
that for a while, looking deep in thought. After some time had
passed, he finally came up with an answer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;At first, it
was his skills that interested me, much like everyone else here. But,
after that, I noticed something, every time he came back to play the
game, he would have grown in strength by leaps and bounds. And for
some reason, watching someone grow from a small little fish, into a
fierce dragon is exciting for me!&quot; Nate explained, glancing at
the match, &quot;Now let's see how much you've grown this time.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The countdown for
the match had begun, and it was time for the two of them to fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately, the
tree-like student placed both of his hands on the ground. As he did
this, multiple thick tree roots started to form across the floor, and
spiralled their way towards Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To counter this
attack, the first thing he did was perform a blood swipe at the
roots, hoping to cut them down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As his blood swipe
attack reached the roots, it caused the first set to break, but that
didn't stop the roots entirely, they kept coming forward. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With his tier two
boots, he was able to outmanoeuvre the roots. Although there were
many of them, and his blood swipes couldn't deal with them all of the
roots, he was able to outrun them with his speed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He circled around
the attack and ended up at the student's side, preparing himself to
do something he had been itching to try out since he had joined the
game today. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After seeing this
the wood user immediately shot out a large trunk from the palm of his
hand that came out straight and fast. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn yelled, &quot;Flash
step!&quot; Performing the flash step, he avoided the attack and was
now even closer to his opponent. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Trees, protect
me!&quot; The wood user shouted and suddenly the user was surrounded
on all sides by thick tree trunks. It was as if a forest had suddenly
sprouted in the middle of the battlefield. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'This is perfect!'
Quinn thought. Right now he wanted to test out an idea he had, and
the student had decided to become a prone target. It was perfect for
his practice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Stopping in his
tracks, he firmly planted both feet on the floor. Then from his toes,
moving up to his hip, he swung out his leg like a whip. While making
all these movements, he started to think back to the feeling of
performing blood swipe in his hands, the rush of energy that flowed
through his body as they left his fingers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While practising his
kicks in the weapons hall, he had pictured this movement several
times, and right now was the first time he was actually combining the
two together. The energy flowed from inside his body and was then
released from his legs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A single large line
of red energy left his leg, and it was shaped like a crescent moon.
It was far larger than that of his regular blood swipe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As it hit the first
set of tree trucks, it managed to slice through them with ease. The
wood ability user ducked down in time, avoiding the attack from
cutting off his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn wasn't
done yet, he hopped and changed his stance slightly, performing the
same kick with his other leg, cutting the trees down from the other
side. Both sides of the tree trunks shook due to the slightly angled
cut and fell to the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The wood user was
now panicking, but before he could even react, Quinn was already
above him, performing a final axe kick, followed which also released
a blood swipe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It had been a while
since Quinn had last fought, and that was against Fex. Before that,
it was against the one scale Dalki. During both of these fights, he
realised that he needed to get stronger. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He knew he still had
a long way to go, but with everything that was happening, he wasn't
sure if he had gotten any stronger. He needed this fight to gauge
just how much he had improved. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Since the last time
he played the game, he had gained a few extra stats, buffing up his
body and his abilities. Even though he couldn't use his shadow skills
in the game, he liked that it would force him to be creative in using
his blood skills while fighting. All these things combined was what
led him to coming up with the new skill in today's match. </FONT></FONT>

popped up without him having levelled up. He also didn't increase any

Kick: When using the skill while performing different types of kicks.

attack carries a distance of ten meters but the aura will get smaller
and weaker the further it travels. Cost: minus 2 HP for every kick] </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Compared to the
Blood Swipe skill the two attacks were quite different. Blood Swipe
released from Quinn's finger tips, forming a claw like shape, and
five small lines of red aura. He could also use Blood Swipe with both
of his hands and bring the lines closer together to form a single
stronger red line. However, this didn't seem to be as effective as
two single Blood Swipes. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The good thing about
blood Swipe was that because it had five separate lines, it covered a
wider range, making it harder for a person to dodge, and they were
more likely to use a block skill. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the Blood
Crescent Kick was a single large line of red aura. It was sharper,
faster, and also had longer range, but didn't have the same wide area
of attack. There was also the fact that it cost 2 HP to use the kick
instead of just 1 HP for a Blood Swipe. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This didn't look

he had against the Dalki, it would soon add up fast. It was one of
the main problems with combining Blood spray into his punches. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex having witnessed
the whole thing was quite amazed. 'Did he come up with that skill
himself? When did he have the time to learn it? I saw him learn the
leg kicks at the same time as me, and how does he know how to use
advanced skills like the flash step? Yet he doesn't even know the
basic hand to hand combat of the vampires.' </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he was deep in
thought, he heard a laugh by his side. &quot;It looks like another
one has been converted into a fan,&quot; Nate said, &quot;You
wouldn't believe it, but every time he fights he shows me something
new, this kid is growing stronger fast.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Every time?&quot;

before?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm positive,&quot;
Nate replied. &quot;The first time we fought I beat him, I beat him
in such a way that made sure he showed me everything he had. But then
I watched him fight against someone else, and he showed me a new
skill, if he had used that in our fight, I don't know how it would
have... Looking at him now he's like an entirely different person
from back then.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If what Nate was
saying was true, Quinn was getting stronger at an incredibly fast
pace. One that hadn't been seen throughout the history of the
vampires. 'Perhaps he is related to them, hmm… But I thought they
all died out, if it's true, it would make sense why he has the shadow
ability. Did they just move to earth instead?' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then sent a
message to Fex, saying he was free to play a few games of his own if
he wanted to. Right now Quinn wanted to practise this move. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex replied back,

fight a couple more times. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went into his
next match making game again, and with it, the crowd had followed. At
first, he found it strange, seeing the people watching him. Since he
had never played the game before, he was wondering if it was normal
for so many people to be spectating one person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Did they randomly
stumble upon his match, or were they there because he had been on a
winning streak for a while now, hoping he would eventually lose. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quin didn't
have time to worry about them, and really needed to worry about
himself. The next game he was placed with a level two. Knowing he
would get no experience in this match he tried to finish it as
quickly as possible. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For Fex though, it
was the first time he had witnessed Quinn using them. He never used
it against him in their fight, possible because Fex was too fast,
because Hammer Strike took a brief moment to charge up. Against these
weak people it was fine, but against someone as fast as Fex it would
allow them to get in a free hit. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'So he does know the
vampire martial arts?!' Fex thought, &quot;Arghh!&quot; He screamed,
as he felt like pulling out his hair. &quot;You know what, I'm going
to have to just stop guessing and find out myself.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Two more matches
where made and this time they were with another Level three user and
a Level four user. These matches were closer and took more time but
they weren't as strong as they could have been. </FONT></FONT>

matched up with second years who seemed to have higher tier beast
equipment. Quinn could only assume that the system had designed it
this way on purpose or just not many second years were playing the

made a mental note to ask him later. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After winning the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as he was
leaving the game, he had received a single message from Nate. &quot;I'll
see you soon, and make sure you join the fighting event.&quot; Quinn
had remembered Nate quite clearly. It was another loss that had stuck
in his mind. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside another VR
gaming room, one of the pod doors was abruptly opened and out stepped
a fairly domineering man with a burly build. His neck was nearly as
wide as his square-shaped head, and for some reason, he had decided
to frame his hair in a way that was similar to how his head was
sculpted. </FONT></FONT>

talk yourself down like that,&quot; Nate replied. &quot;Remember,
he's only a first-year and there are two major differences between
the first years and the second years. One of which is our equipment.&quot;
Nate said, pointing to the cape that was on Sam's back. </FONT></FONT>

treated like a king at his school.&quot; Sam replied. </FONT></FONT>

white as pure flakes of snow. Although her features looked soft, as
serious expression was plastered on her face. Yet, the thing that
stood out the most about her, was her silver hair. She was wearing
the standard black military uniform that they all had to wear. This
contrasted beautifully with her hair which was coloured with the
brilliance of silver jewellery and tied up in a single ponytail, with
a length that managed to reach down to her waist. As if she was
unaware of the silence in the room, she sauntered to the centre of
the room, and started addressing the students. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far, for
everyone, it has been a normal day. They ate their morning food as
usual and then went to their morning homeroom classes. It was now
lunchtime, after which they usually had their combat classes. At that
moment Vorden, Quinn, and Peter were having lunch outside, when Quinn
received a ping on his watch. </FONT></FONT>

he and the boys were outside on a bench with nobody else around.
Vorden and Peter then huddled around Quinn to hear the message
better, and to also make sure no one came close, they each kept an
eye out to see if someone was approaching, so then they could quickly
stop the message if someone came into earshot. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good,&quot;
The message said as it continued to play. &quot;I received some
interesting information and it concerns Peter and your little
problem. I suggest you gather everyone that knows about what Peter
really is and bring them to my room. Because we are going to need
everyone's help on this to get out of this mess. Oh, and if you could
bring me a sandwich from one of the vending machines that would be
good. You don't have to do this, of course, but it will be good for
my brainpower and help me think better.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although the tone of
the message didn't sound very urgent, Quinn knew that if Logan was
initiating contact with him, and was asking to bring everyone into
his room it was a big deal. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The girls along with
Vorden and Peter were patiently waiting inside Logan's room. The boys
were quite calm, while Erin was nervously tapping her foot. Lately,
she had been using all her spare time to practice her sword skills,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Layla who was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This is a very
serious matter,&quot; Logan replied, sitting in his chair. He was
currently playing with a trapezium style Rubik's cube made from
metal. The inside used little small triggers to twist and turn the
shape in all sorts of different directions. This made it multiple
times harder than a standard Rubik's cube. Each time he shifted one
of the pieces, a large mechanical sound would be made. &quot;And I
would hate to have to repeat myself again, so we will wait until
everyone is here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait, I was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, please

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As usual, when Logan
was explaining things, he would display what he was looking at on his
computer screen to the others through a hologram. As he went through
files one by one he would explain what they meant. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When I woke up
this morning I was surprised to see an envelope on the floor.&quot;
Logan said, &quot;I was afraid that it might be some type of a bomb
or something. So I had my mechanical spiders go ahead and pick it up,
and then inspect it. I scanned it for any traces of tampering and to
see what was inside. To my surprise, there was a little nano stick
inside together with a note.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The screen had
changed and right now, a scanned version of the note was being
displayed to the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;On this nano
stick is some information about one of the members of a big four
family, more specifically it's about one of the leaders known as
Truedream. Our group has managed to gather evidence after doing
extensive research into him, and here you will find all his
wrongdoings from the past. The reason why I have passed this note
onto you is that unfortunately for all of you… Truedream will be
arriving at this military base in a few days' time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Out of
everyone, I thought perhaps with your abilities you might be able to
do something to stop this madness, for we wish do not wish anyone
innocent to get hurt.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the end of the
letter attached to the bottom was a stamp, and everyone in the room
recognized it immediately. They had seen it many times on the
television, and some of them had even written school reports about
the group. It was the stamp from the group known as Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what if
Truedream is coming to the school?&quot; Erin replied. &quot;He does
a routine visit to most of the military bases anyway. I fail to see
why this is our problem, and why we should even trust the words
coming from a rogue rebel faction?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know,&quot;
Layla said. &quot;Maybe they know something that we don't, and I'm
guessing it has something to do with that nano stick.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Although I
would like to say congratulations,&quot; Logan said in a deadpan way,
&quot;I believe anyone would have been able to come to that
conclusion.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The files on the
hologram changed once again, and this time they contained reports of
the previous visits that Truedream had made. It contained detailed
reports of each visit to the military base but not only that... It
also informed them of what Truedream's true purpose for coming to the
base was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fact that every
time he visited, a select few students would be chosen, and soon
after their abilities were gone. It also showed that there was a
pattern to these things and how he seemed to visit the second
military base more often than the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The expression on
everyone's faces was sour as they read the reports. &quot;I can't say
that it surprises me,&quot; Quinn said, with a look of disgust on his
face, &quot;It's expected of this crappy system.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I agree it's
bad,&quot; Erin said. &quot;But still I don't really see how this
involves us. We're just students and they want us to stop this. He's
from one of the big four families. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was when Vorden
noticed something. &quot;Wait did you say the visit was in a few
days. Isn't that….&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like we
have a winner,&quot; Logan said, &quot;This is the reason why I
called you all. I remember you telling me that for some reason Duke,
had deliberately wanted Peter to reach ability level four…&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Logan continued, &quot;It
seemed strange, but why were they suddenly showing favoritism to
Peter? And what's with the rush?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Putting these
two things together it makes sense. Not only was Peter originally
weak, but he also had no strong family backing, sure his family would
be upset if he was to lose his powers or disappear, but no further
steps would be taken, and everyone would soon forget about it, just
like what happened with the students before.&quot; Logan explained. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And if they
find out that Peter has no abilities anymore, they will start asking
questions all over again, and it could lead them back to us,&quot;
Vorden said. &quot;Not just the vampire stuff, but when they find out
we were close to Peter, they might start looking into the deaths
again, and more.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group had to
take their time to take everything in. Out of all of them, the first
one to leave the room was Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't mean
to be rude or anything but I'm not really that involved with you
guys,&quot; Erin said. &quot;I'm not a vampire, and I have no ties to
what you did with the others. If I help out in this it will only make
me a bigger target. If you guys are caught trying to do anything, it
could come back to me. I can't let that happen.&quot; She finished,
with an apologetic look on her face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Erin left the
room not a single person had gone out to chase her. She had a point.
She really wasn't involved in any of this, and if she did help out
now, it would only put her at risk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We have two
days,&quot; Logan said. &quot;This Sunday the students will be asked
to gather in the assembly hall to welcome Truedream. Usually, the
selected students are asked to stay back after the assembly. This is
what it says in the reports, they will then be taken somewhere, but
the location is unknown. Where could it be?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nobody knows…&quot;
Logan said, and then waited for dramatic effect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;All that we
know is that these students who are taken away lost their abilities.
The world is given the explanation that they have been punished for
doing something bad, so their ability got taken away, and some even
disappeared.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So, what plans
can we come up with?&quot; He asked the group in general. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group then
continued to discuss what could happen, and came up with different
plans and scenarios in case different things happened. Finally, after
a long talk, they had come up with a plan that seemed to have a good
chance of working. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And it was like
Logan had said, for this to work they would need everyone who was
here to help. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This included Fex
and surprisingly he had agreed without saying too much. If he was
discovered by his family now, he would get into so much trouble. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he knew that if
the world discovered the existence of vampires and it was because of
him, it didn't matter who his father was no one could save him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the plan set,
everyone left the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, they would
all act as normal as possible for the next couple of days until
Truedream arrived. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When everyone had
finally left the room, Logan turned towards his computer once more,
and started to play a video file. Logan was a very cautious person
and was paranoid that everyone was out there to steal his work. The
school didn't allow any cameras but that didn't mean he couldn't
install any of his own. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the VIP area,
Logan had set tiny miniature cameras that were close to invisible to
the human eye. He installed them, not only on his front door but also
a few on the outside as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After receiving the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Naturally, the first
thing he did, was to check and see who had delivered the letter. As
the video played, it was clear as day, that Layla was the one who had
delivered the letter. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Layla, huh?

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Truedream is
different from the other big families,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;The
families had their powers long before the world knew they even
existed, slowly passing it down from family to family member. And to
be honest, even within all the ability users, the three families
always reigned on the top.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, this is
what I mean when I say the Trudream family are a little different.
For one, most of his family actually consist of multiple different
ability users. This is due to the nature of his ability. The second
thing is Truedream had discovered the ability himself later in life,
we believe he is the first to have this power. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;His ability is
unique and we're not even sure if he can pass it on for others to
learn or not. The military who are partners with him, like to keep it
this way. Remember its only because of him that so many of those in
power chose to not disobey. Anyone who tries to fight back or rebel
gets their powers taken away. There are even rumours it was because
of Truedream that the Pure faction had started in the first place. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Once your
ability gets taken away, there's no way for the body to learn another
one and for some reason, it seems like Truedream's ability stops you
from completely producing any more mutant cells for your old ability.
As you know, someone without an ability can't get very far in the
outside world at the moment.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was true,
currently, in the outside world, most of the things that couldn't be
done with abilities were already automated with technology. Everyone
then recived a universal income, but it wasn't enough credits to live
on earth, causing most of the humans to relocate to shelters on other
planets, some that were less protected than others. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although, even after
Fex had heard Vorden's explanation this Truedream person still didn't
seem like a big deal to him. Even if Fex's ability did get taken
away, there was nothing he could do about his vampire powers. Also,
it seemed like Truedream himself was very weak, so he didn't
understand the fear associated with his powers that the others had. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fex and Quinn

kicking and blocking each other's attacks at a normal speed. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had a lot on

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, a
wight's strength is mirrored by his creator's strength, and his
creator has to be a leader,&quot; Fex explained. &quot;Which makes me
think why he even left the ghoul in the first place or why he hasn't
come back to pick it up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well it
doesn't have to be a leader, right?&quot; Quinn said nervously hoping
to throw Fex of this dangerous trail. &quot;Any Vampire can turn
someone?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had made sure
to check this fact with the system beforehand, and it was true that
most Vampires could turn someone. However, depending on their power
it limited how many people they could turn. At most a regular Vampire
could only turn one person. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
serious? Did they really teach you nothing here?&quot; Fex said as he
let out a sigh. &quot;Although it's true that a vampire can turn
anyone it is against the laws. The only person who has permission to
turn someone is the leader of one of the thirteen families. If anyone
else was to turn someone that would be classified as an illegal. The
vampire and whoever created it would be taken back to be executed.&quot;

both considered illegal in the eyes of the Vampire families? </FONT></FONT>

you are not illegal.&quot; The system said. &quot;However, I didn't
want to tell you this so soon for you still are not strong enough and

Peter and created your own family name. You too are now a vampire
Leader. But as I stated before if you want to live, never reveal this
information to anyone.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Fex didn't
say anything else, he had kept a few things to himself. Wight's were
known to only follow one person, otherwise, their natural nature

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The humans and
vampires share more than they would like to admit. Just how humans
were selfish and decided to keep their abilities to themselves it is
the same for the Vampires. Each Vampire has a basic set of skills,

different abilities they have. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This does not
mean, they are all related by blood however, before learning an
ability a vampire must go through a blood ritual with that family,
meaning they can never go against them. Only then will they teach
that vampire their ability. An example of this is the Sanguinis
family that Fex is a part of, who have the ability to control
strings. Still, this does not mean a vampire cannot learn an ability
outside of the thirteen, but if they chose to do this, they will
never be promoted within the ranks of the family they have chosen to
follow.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

learn them. And what was the chance Quinn would be able to stumble
upon another book that vampires were able to learn? Thinking about

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Over at the
elemental training hall. Vorden and Peter were keeping their distance
as usual, but Vorden had been keeping his eye on Peter the whole
lesson. So far nothing new happened and like Quinn's beast weapons
class was focussing on the same lesson the whole week, so was theirs.
But as the lesson was about to finish, the students had some free
time to practise what they had learned, or do something else they
wanted. Once again Bones had come over with his three men and
confronted Peter, but Vorden decided to see how things would play out
before he would step in. </FONT></FONT>

was a level four user, while Peter was still level three, and a new

couldn't have learnt that many skills with the ability in such a

he had the level four earth ability copied, if necessary he would be

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Bones immediately

chin, knocking him out in one blow. </FONT></FONT>

two of groups, and at the same time bones had been blocked from
Peter's view. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden and
Peter where outside, Vorden decided it was best if they headed back
to the dorm room for now and stayed there. While heading back Vorden
was thinking about the confrontation, and how it had shown him how
much Peter had changed. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Seeing how he acted
against Bones, he couldn't imagine what Peter might do if he was to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the dorm
room, Vorden and Peter hadn't said much. They were no longer as close
as before, when Vorden used to mentor Peter. In fact, when Vorden
looked at Peter now, he would no longer see the same Peter as before.
Now he just got this weird feeling when they were together, and he
found it strange that Peter would often remained still in one place
for long periods of time, coming from Vorden this was saying a lot
about how much Peter had really changed. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, when Quinn
had returned from his class, the first thing Vorden did, was ask him

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If that is

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
decided to take a walk down the hallway until they had reached a
window. Making sure there wasn't anyone who could be listening in on
their conversation, they looked outside allowing the breeze to touch
their face as they talked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had explained
what had happened today in the training hall, and he also told him

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know I have
mentioned it before,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;But last time I said it
half-heartedly, but this time Quinn I'm serious. I think we should
cut our ties with Peter.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Vorden had
sugar coated his words, Quinn knew what Vorden was getting at, and in
his opinion they should kill Peter. Honestly, with everything going
on, Quinn couldn't say he hadn't had the same thoughts. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lately, this thought
was entering Quinn's head more often, this Peter wasn't the same one
he knew, it was clear the old weak Peter was already gone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think trying
to go through with this plan, is much riskier than just getting rid
of Peter,&quot; Vorden said. &quot;I think we can do Peter justice
when we leave school in two years, we'll look after his family. We
can make our own faction, and the money we earn from being Travellers
we will send them a portion each month.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was making a
good case, but Quinn wondered how Peter's family would feel after
finding out their son had died or disappeared. Would they really care
if they had money or not? Even if Peter wasn't the same as before he
was still him right? There still had to be a little of him inside
there somewhere. On top of that Quinn was feeling this connection
with Peter through their vampire bond, and he might need Peter later
to defend himself from the other vampires. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I for one
don't think this is a good idea,&quot; The system said. &quot;First
of all, you won't be able to kill Peter yourself. If you decide to go
through with this, you would have to stand by as you watched someone
you know kill Peter, and although he is loyal to you, he would not
just stand there without putting up a fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The second
thing goes to the matter we spoke of before, you were lucky Peter
turned into a wight. It is quite a powerful alley to have. Right now
you need to gather and keep all the power you can get. It's not a
question of if the vampires will come for you Quinn, It's when!&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the system
confirmed his earlier thoughts, suddenly a strange feeling came over
him once again, it was the family connection from the blood ritual.
It came up as if to say, you shouldn't do this! &quot;I can't do it
Vorden,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;He's family now and so are you and
the others.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't know
this, but as he turned to Vorden and said these words, his eyes were
lit up bright Red. Vorden assumed that perhaps this matter went far
beyond the conversation they had just now, and had something to do
with Quinn himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Letting out a sigh

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next day it was
the start of the weekend, so the group had no classes to attend for
the day. However, they were unable to spend their time freely like

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of them went

Truedream arrives</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was now Sunday
morning and the eight sergeants had all gathered inside the portal
hall. Four of the second year sergeants stood on one side and four of
the first year sergeants stood on the opposite side, forming two
lines in front of the portal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of them had
straightened postures and were unmoveable, assuming their best
attitude before the single portal. The said portal had been pulled
out and placed in the centre of the room. Although the colour of this
portal was neither green, orange, nor red, it was hued in the purity
of white, making it look like a blank canvas. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like the
travelling stations, the white colour indicated that the destination
of the portal was Earth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The doors to the
training hall soon opened and every one of the sergeants immediately
gave a salute to the four men who had entered the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Duke - The head of
the second-year students, Nathan - The head of the first-year
students, and Mike stood in the centre. Out of all the generals
there, Mike was the oldest and was well respected. Even though he
didn't hold the highest rank, he was still in charge of the
communications that would transpire in between military bases. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, finally,
standing behind the three of them was a man in a black and white
tailored suit. The others had never seen him wear anything else other
than that. It was the head general Paul. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Duke, I hope
you already have everything prepared, yes?&quot; Paul asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes,
everything is proceeding well and we should reach the quota as usual.
All the students will gather in the assembly hall this afternoon. We
shall advance with everything else right after.&quot; Duke replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good.&quot;
Said Paul, looking at another comrade next. &quot;Mike, how are the
preparations for the upcoming event going?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not to worry,
we still have a leeway of a month before the event. Students will be
able to choose which events they want to participate in soon. I'm
sure that we'll come out on top this year - I know we will.&quot;
Mike said as he laughed loudly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nathan, I'm
afraid I have some bad news for you.&quot; Said Paul. &quot;The
upcoming portal outing for the first-year students, it will not be a
green portal like how we originally planned it, but it will be an
orange portal instead.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hearing this,
Nathans's eyes widened. &quot;Sir, this is crazy! They're only
first-year students. Why do we need to push them so fast?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There are
reports that the Dalki are becoming more aggressive with their
exploration. We must compete with them. This order has been made by
all of us, so we must push more and at the same time, we can not
willingly lose our regular men. Earth is the number one priority and
we must protect it at all cost.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So they chose
to sacrifice the children instead!&quot; Nathan complained back,
utterly distraught by the news. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;War will soon
be waged and the Dalki do not discriminate, whether they are children
or not. Age will not matter to them when that time comes. It's better
that they get the experience now. I will give you permission to send
a couple of sergeants with them for their safeguarding rather than
the regular teachers, but that's it. This is an order and it's final.
I don't want to welcome any opposition.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, green
portals would be used for first years. They were the safest,
containing basic and intermediate beasts. Once the student reached
the second year stage, they would then, though only once, go out on
an orange portal expedition. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Orange portals posed
a heightened risk. There were shelters on the planet, but the whole
planet had yet to be explored. The moment that the military arrived
on that planet, the goal would be to expand and explore the areas of
the planet that had yet to be explored. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If they were lucky
and finished their exploration, it would get the go-ahead and the
portal colour would change to green. If they discovered high-level
beasts, then the portal would retain its orange colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nathan felt like the
first years were way too inexperienced to do such a task. The main
difference when travelling to an orange portal planet was that they
would travel as a single unit instead of in teams. Furthermore, the
school had yet to enlighten the students about the importance of
working together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The generals now
stood a few feet away from the circular teleporter. Paul lifted his
wrist to look at his watch, checking the time - It was currently
8:59. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the watch
displayed 9:00, the portal started to warp slightly, and three
figures could be seen coming through. Standing in the centre was a
bald-headed man who wore sunglasses and he had also donned a suit. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Jack!&quot;
Greeted Paul. &quot;It's been a while.&quot; He said as he went to
the others and gave them a hug. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's him?&quot;
Fay whispered to Hayley who was standing next to her. &quot;I can't
believe that two of the strongest people on our planet look like
shady businessmen.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Jack
Truedream didn't look impressive by himself, the two men who came out
of the portal beside him did. One of them was a large fellow whose
height was nearly seven feet. He was completely covered in a grey
coloured beast equipment, which looked similar to a rhino, while he
carried a large two-handed axe on his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By his side was an
individual who was the complete opposite, a small skinny fellow. This
person was wearing beast equipment that was dark green in hue and had
a mask covering his face. Although, instead of a heavy armour like
the other person, he wore light armour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, just from
gazing at both of their equipment, Fay could tell that they were
high-level beast gear, way beyond that of the advanced tier. Jack
truly had brought his strongest guards along. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It reminded Fay that
even though they were allies. Still, at the same time, they weren't.
The fact that Jack felt the need to bring these two was to remind
them of the power that his family had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, there was
an odd balance between the ability users in the world that caused
small-scaled skirmishes to happen. The military's strongest force was
the 8 head generals that were in charge of each of the military
bases. The leader of this group was the head general in military base
one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In addition to them
was the big four from the four families. They were the current
decision-makers in the affairs concerning the world, and whenever
there was a serious matter to be decided, a meeting would be called
in their midst. Once in a while though, the families or the military
would have to show their strength just to make sure that the others
wouldn't get the idea of rebelling. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How about some
breakfast together? My chiefs have prepared a great meal.&quot; Paul
asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No thanks, I
ate before I came here,&quot; Jack replied. &quot;I was actually
hoping to speak to your sergeants who discovered one of our family
members. I believe that when his body was discovered, it was found
along with two other students, is that correct? I wish to investigate
this matter before I do anything else. If you don't mind, that is.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, honestly
I'm not sure of the details myself,&quot; Paul replied. &quot;I
surmised that Hayley was the one who wrote the report and sent it off
to you. Hayley!&quot; Paul called her and she immediately rushed
over, giving a salute to both Paul and Jack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please, if you
can, help Jack in any way possible.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Of course,
sir!&quot; Hayley replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was the real
reason why Jack had decided to visit the military base. His original
plan was to visit the particular place later. However, when he learnt
that one of his men had died in the same way as one of his previous
guys, he felt the need to investigate. Perhaps, whatever had killed
Ian was the same thing that killed one of his top men. He was hoping
that he could find answers from the two students who were found with
the body at the time. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now both Jack
and Hayley were both inside the medical office. Hayley was sitting
down at her computer while Jack was standing just above her shoulder
taking a peek at the screen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is this the

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack gave it a quick
read over and it was the same report that he had received from her
before. &quot;When you recovered his body, other than the two boys
that were with him in the place, was there anyone else or anything
inside?&quot; Jack asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nothing that I
can remember. Although now that you mention it, it did seem a little
strange?&quot; Hayley said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well even
though everything was supposedly destroyed, the whole training centre
was left untouched due to it being made of glathrium. It looks like
not a single beast had managed to get inside the place. Yet, when we
entered. It seemed like the whole place had been trashed, as if a
huge brawl had taken place.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley then went
into detail describing what the scene looked like, how there were
several mangled doors and how chairs from the arena were all over the
place and crumbled up. She then also went into detail about
Truedream's body when they recovered it. The bottom half was still
intact while the top half had the same two bite marks on it. She also
did a quick on the spot evaluation and found that the body seemed to
have died not too long ago. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It sounds like
Ian must have had fought something while he was in there.&quot; Jack
said.&quot; Ian's ability was magnetism, judging by the scene you
were describing, whatever he was fighting with at the time managed to
kill him. Do you have the name of the two boys, if they were there
then they must have at least saw something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Hayley felt
the same way, the boys had already been interrogated several times
over the event. Right now, Hayley felt like the most possible thing
was a beast. Something might have attached themselves to one of the
students and got on to their scent. It followed behind them, killing
people in the process and causing small puncture wounds on their
neck. This was the only logical conclusion she could come to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Still, she didn't
want to inform Jack of all the previous investigations they had
already done. He was in a way higher position than her. She had also
heard rumours of his bad side. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Jack was
apparently a pleasant person, he thanked the military for helping and
taking him in, promising to always help them out. But as he got
better abilities and more people on his side, the demands he started
making were ridiculous. Nowadays if he didn't get his way, there was
no telling what would happen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two students
files were brought up, the first one was Quinn. Jack quickly scanned
it over, but as soon as he saw he was only a level one ability user,
he quickly disregarded it, the next person though was Vorden who
interested him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On his file, it
stated his initial testing was a level 5 but next to it in brackets,
they said it was (subject to changes) and it was also stated that he
was an original. The school already knew Vorden's power due to the
information passed on to the previous school but just for filing
sake, they took down his initial score. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Jack was reading
through the file, that's when he spotted the name. &quot;Vorden
Blade.&quot; After reading this name out loud a memory had popped

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Several years ago
Jack had had his power for a few years now and his family members
were starting to grow, he had been called in for a meeting. This
meeting was between the big three powers. The strongest originals. He
was invited to a private island where a large mansion sat on the
highest point. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He remembered each
of their presence that day as they sat on a round table opposite to
each other. The pressure coming of each of them was immense. After
all, they were the strongest people in the world. They didn't rule it
by political gains or winning the peoples hearts like in the past. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead, they ruled
it through their own power and an iron fist, and just looking at them
he could see that. There was no military there, no government, there
was just the three leaders of the family and himself. They didn't
need any guards with the. What was the point when they were stronger
than any guards they could hire? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The meeting had come
as a surprise because the reason he was called, was because they
wanted him to have a seat at the leader's table. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The leader's table
consisted of the eight head generals and currently the heads of the
three big families. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had
acknowledged the strength of Jack and his family had at that time.
And on that day it went from the big three to the big four. However
one thing had stuck in his mind, there was one rule they stated
before he left… &quot;To never touch the Blade family.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Jack
thought it was a joke as he started to laugh, he had heard of every
single one of them out there. He even knew several other big name
original families out there in the real world, but he had yet to have
heard of this Blade family before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But soon after he
realised that each of them were dead serious, the pressure they were
emitting just seconds ago seemed to completely vanish at the mention
of this family name. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
report once again, he looked at the name carefully. 'Could this
really be related to the same family they were talking about?' Jack
thought. 'Would they really care if I got rid of one kid, or maybe
they were behind the deaths of my men in the first place.' </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to think
about what to do and decided to go confront Vorden. However, every
time he felt like he was about to do this, images popped back up in
his head of the strong men on the table that day. Just what had
gotten them so worked up? </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The assembly hall
was split into two equal half's, with all the first year students
standing on the left of the stage, and the second year students
standing right of the stage. The fact that all the students in the
school were told to gather together, and not just a single year told
them it would be a big event. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the two section
on each side would be further split up, they were grouped by each
homeroom class which contained about fifty students. Quinn and Vorden
were standing relatively close to each other while Peter was standing
a row in front of them so they could keep an eye on him. While the
girls stood directly at the front of the class. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Their section was
stationed closest to the stage, while right at the back towards the
exit was Logan. To his surprise, it seemed like Fex was in the same
homeroom class as him. Logan didn't turn up to home room class much,
and if it was anyone else they would have been punished for this. But
because Logan was a VIP student from a rich family he obtained
special privileges. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Raten you
remember the plan right?&quot; Vorden asked. &quot;As soon as you
finish with what needs to be done, then you get out of there. I don't
care if someone looks interesting to fight, or if someone looked at
you the wrong way, we need to disappear immediately after you are
done.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Will you shut
up?!&quot; Raten snapped back. &quot;For the last two days, you've

what you said, I won't hear the end of it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden, hated the
fact that the plan required him to use Raten, if he could he would
have used himself but the task that was given to him relied on him
having two abilities and Vorden could only control one, but of
course, using Sil was out of the question, so that left him with
Raten. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two abilities he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn, on the other
hand, was worried for Peter. The system recommended giving Peter some
of his blood which he did, and he gave the order not to attack Duke
or Jack. With the extra blood it made Peter more loyal to the point
he would obey every order, loyalty to one's master was also distance
based, the further away, the less influence the master's orders had,
but with fresh blood from Quinn in his system he would have no option
but to obey the commands he was given. Eventually, the power would
fade away but for a short time period like this one, it would be
enough. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only way that

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Duke pointed at one
of the men who sat at the leader's table, and was actually the leader
of one of the big four. &quot;Please clap for Mr. Truedream.&quot;
Duke said as he walked off the stage. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. Truedream then
got up from his seat at the table, and come up from the side of the
stage, and as he stepped forward so did the two guards next to him.
The students looked up and stared at them in awe. They had never seen
such impressive beast gear in their life, and couldn't imagine just
how much it would cost to own them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Knowing that they
were from the Truedream family, they would also have some impressive
abilities. However, as most of the students looked at Mr. Truedream,
they were quite disappointed. He wasn't wearing any beast gear, and
he didn't give off the same presence as other leaders they had seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, there were
a few in the room who felt differently, they could feel a confidence
exuding from his body, and one of these students was Fex. As he was
looking at him he was starting to sweat, the site of Mr. Truedream
reminded him of the thirteen vampire leaders. This was the presence
of someone who was on top of the world. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Many of you
should know who I am but just in case, my name is Jack Truedream,
leader of the Truedream family and also the owner of Dreamland City.
I have a close relationship with the military and I visit every base
each year. But I have to say out of all the military bases, this is
my favourite one. I also seem to get the most and the best gifts
delivered directly to my footstep here.&quot; Jack said with a smile.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did you hear

whispered. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you an

to,&quot; Another student responded. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;True, but
still if we could get into his faction, we would be set for life. I
hear he even provides free housing for all those in his city. As long
as you join their team of course,&quot; The first student replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the other
students were excited to see Truedream, Quinn's group could see the
other hidden message behind his words. Most likely those gifts he was
talking about, were the students given to him right after this
assembly. He was declaring it in the open, while no one knew what was
happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the speech
continued on, from the bottom of Logan's sleeve one of the small
mechanical spiders crawled down his shirt, and hopped off his shoe.
It was the same size as a regular small spider, and made next to no
noise as it moved about. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jack then spoke his
final words. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the
speech was over, and Jack walked off stage with his two guards behind
him. Heading off to a location out of sight from all the students.
While doing this the mechanical spider quickly followed along. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Jack left the
stage Duke returned, he had one last thing to say to everyone, &quot;You
