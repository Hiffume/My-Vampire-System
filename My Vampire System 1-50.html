<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Try not to die
by tripping over yourself, Quinn!&quot; A boy shouted down the
hallway, laughing uncontrollably right after. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn dismissed the
petty mockery as he carried on walking down the school corridor. The
harassment had become a daily occurrence for him, but it still
bothered him just as much as it did every other day. Thus, he wasn't
able to hold back his desire to retaliate. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn slowed down
his stride and stopped. He pushed his glasses back up onto the ridge
of his nose as they had slipped down from his face. Just from looking
at the glasses, it was clear that he needed a new pair - One could
tell that they were heavily worn. The glasses looked crooked as he
wore it, and even the temples were covered with tape. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then turned
around and immediately raised his middle finger, responding to the
slander, &quot;I bet you don't even know how many fingers I'm holding
up!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Upon hearing the
taunt, the boy clenched his fist and started running towards Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You level 1
piece of crap! When are you going to learn that you don't belong in
this world?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The boy proceeded to
place both of his hands together and a green ball of light started to
form in between them. When he was only a few meters away from Quinn,
the boy threw his hands forward and a green beam shot out from the
palm of his hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had nowhere to
go and the ray of light was too fast for him to dodge. Hence, he knew
that all he could do was to grit his teeth and bear the pain. As the
light hit Quinn, his body was lifted into the air and sent flying
backwards on to the far end corridor wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's going
on?&quot; A student among the crowd said. &quot;Are they fighting on
the last day of school?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A crowd had
immediately formed outside, interested in what the commotion was all
about. One of the female students ran over to the damaged part of the
wall to check on the assaulted student's safety. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the process of
the dust starting to settle down, Quinn's slightly curly black hair
slowly came into view. When the smoke eventually cleared up, the
female student finally saw who it was. She instantly backed away and
continued on with her business as if nothing happened. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The moment that the
female student had returned to her friends, Quinn could see that they
were laughing at her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can't
believe you tried to help him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I didn't see
who it was.&quot; The girl retorted, her cheeks flushed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After that, Quinn
stood up and lifted his glasses that were thrown on the floor. To his
dismay, one of the hinges had fallen off once again. Instead of
wearing the worn-out pair, he let it hand on his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was the last day
of school for Quinn, so he was hoping that someone wouldn't try
anything with him. He was sick and tired of their doings, but he
wasn't the type to ignore those either. He had seen people who had
chosen to keep their head down and tolerate the harassment. However,
their treatment was far worse than what he received. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't bother
to stay at school like the rest of the students. As he walked past,
he saw the students having conversations among themselves in their
circles - Some were laughing while some had tears, thinking it was
the last time they would ever see each other again. However, Quinn
wasn't a part of any of that and he didn't want to be. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he finally
arrived home, he immediately went to work. Living in a single bedroom
apartment that had just enough space to fit a single bed and desk was
enough for him. There was also a TV that was mounted on the wall, but
Quinn would merely use it as a source of background noise and didn't
actually watch anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The apartment was
provided to him by the government, since he had no living relatives
and was only 16 years of age. On top of his bed was a single suitcase
that contained all of his belongings that were neatly packed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He walked towards a
cabinet, immediately pulling a drawer open which accommodated a
single book. It was a large and thick hard-bound book, weighing about
half a kilo. The front cover of the book was in a colour that
mimicked a lighter shade of blood. In the centre, the lonesome fronts
of an upper and lower jaw bone could be seen, both coloured in the
swampy shade of brown. The upper jaw sort of had four separated
fangs. Meanwhile, the lower one had two sharp teeth on the two far
ends on the overhead and five evenly spaced underneath. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's try
again today,&quot; Quinn said as he lifted the book and placed it on
top of the desk. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then quickly went
to his bag to pull out a little test tube that was half-filled with a
colourless liquid. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Test 112,
Hydrochloric acid. Let's see how it goes?&quot; Quinn then started to
slowly pour the liquid out of the test tube onto the book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So far, there
is no reaction.&quot; Quinn proceeded to continue to pour all of the
contents of the test tube on the book, but there was no reaction at
the end of his experiment. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn carefully
examined the book while jotting down the results in his notebook.
Seeing if there was any damage done, yet the book looked the same as
always. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Another
failure. Why won't you open? Why did mum and dad even have this
thing?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One hundred and
twelve times - This was the number of different ways that Quinn had
tried to open the book. Not only did the book not open, but it seemed
like it cannot be damaged either. He had even tried burning the book,
cutting the book, melting the book, though nothing had worked against
the book that seemed utterly durable. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went to lie on
his bed and turned on the TV for its sole purpose, making background
noises. He never really paid attention to what was on. With it, the
sound of other voices made him feel less lonely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Upon opening, the TV
displayed an ongoing NEWS show. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The peace
treaty with the Dalki race has lasted for five years now, but
officials are saying that tension is rising once again. Now, we must
prepare for another war….&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The mention of war
had always been shown on the TV nonstop ever since a certain day
thirty years ago. The human race received a visit from the so-called
Dalki. They had the physique of humans, except for their skins that
were riddled with scales and the presence of tails that were similar
to what the dragons had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With no real clue of
why they had suddenly appeared, they immediately demanded that the
Human race hand over their resources and wanted to use them as
slaves. Of course, the humans decided to fight back but they quickly
found out that their modern technology was useless against them.
Bullets couldn't penetrate their skin and as for tanks, well Dalki
had airships. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every individual,
disregarding the gender, was told to fight for their planet and that
included Quinn's parents. The war went on for years, so Quinn grew up
not knowing what his parents looked like. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the humans were
on the brink of defeat, a select group of people came forward - These
people had special abilities. They began sharing their knowledge of
how they obtained such power in hopes of turning the tide in the war,
and thankfully, it worked. Even so, the Dalki were still strong and a
seemingly endless stalemate led to the peace treaty signing five
years ago. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Obviously enough,
human greed got the better of humanity and instead of sharing these
powers with everybody else, the higher-ranked governmental officials
decided to keep them for themselves. Only those with money were able
to learn the more powerful abilities while everyone else was left
with scraps. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was something
that needed to be done. Poverty had taken of the world but unlike
before people had powers and were using them uncontrollably. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was given
nothing when his parents died. The government agreed to pay for his
living expenses all the while he was still in school, but that was
it. When his parents died, him being at the age of ten, an agent
appeared at his doorstep and handed him a book. He was told that it
was the only thing that his parents possessed - One that they passed
down when they died. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why is the
world so unfair?&quot; He uttered, lamenting about his situation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn got out of his
bed and started sauntering en route his desk. He picked up his
glasses that were still slightly broken and decided that he needed to
fix them. He noticed that one of the lenses was slightly out of
place. Thus, he tried to punch it back into its frame. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on! Just
get in!&quot; He shouted as he tried to forcefully fix the glasses. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately, the
lens suddenly crumbled into pieces, one of the shards of plastic even
created a deep gash in his thumb. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn immediately
started to clean up the little pieces of glass, noticing that a piece
had landed on top of his book. As Quinn removed the piece of glass, a
drop of blood from his thumb landed on the centre of the book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The object plastered
on the centre of the book started to glow, and suddenly, the book
began to float, hovering until it was on eye-level with Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The book started to
emit a blinding radiance as it shook uncontrollably. A few seconds
later, it finally opened up, pages after pages were being turned.
Quinn couldn't take his eyes off of the shining book - It was as if
he was in a deep trance. The words written on the pages of the book
weren't in any language that he had seen before. Nevertheless, for
some reason, he felt like he could understand it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the book
reached its last page, it started to disappear, gradually turning
into dust. At the same time, his body suddenly felt weak. Quinn's
vision was starting to fade, and with that, his eyes shut. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Gradually, Quinn's
eyelids started to flutter open and his vision soon returned.
Although, his head felt heavy and his body was slightly sore. As he
lifted himself off of the ground, he touched his head to see if he
had gotten any injuries. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Why does my head
hurt so much?' He thought, bewildered of what just happened to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After making sure
that his skull hadn't split open from falling over, Quinn then went
to pick up his glasses that were thrown on the floor not to far from
him. Regrettably, there was only one lens that was left intact,
still, Quinn put the glasses on out of habit. All of a sudden, he
felt a little disoriented and his vision was slightly blurry. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He took them back
off and noticed that his vision only turned hazy when he put the
glasses on. Quinn immediately rushed to his desk to grab a pencil. He
proceeded to draw the letter &quot;A&quot; on the wall and stepped
back. He continued to step back until his back had hit the wall that
was on the other side of the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What?! But
how?!&quot; Quinn screamed in his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Somehow, Quinn's
vision was now perfect. He had lived his whole life with terrible
eyesight, but strangely, he could now see clearly. Images then
started to flash in his head regarding what had happened before he
passed out. After reminiscing, he could only think of one thing that
caused the miracle - The book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn surveyed
the room, he started to panic. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The book!
Where the hell's the book?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked
everywhere for the book, yet he couldn't find anything. It couldn't
have gone missing in such a small room, so its disappearance was
making Quinn go mad. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe it's
like my socks. They go missing all the time. Ahh, don't be stupid.
This is a book we're talking about, not a sock.&quot; He muttered,
trying to reason the uncanny comparison. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn attempted to
think hard about what had occurred a few moments before he collapsed.
He suddenly started to remember the book hovering in the air. Then,
just before closing his eyes, he heard a few words. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was it?
It sounded like some type of system message?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Quinn
said those words, a status screen had appeared right in front of his
eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wow! It's like
those really old games that people used to play all the time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn noticed that,
on the status screen, there were more tabs that were placed on the
top. Accordingly, even without doing anything and just by reading the
tabs in his head, the screen automatically switched to the &lt;Skills&gt;
tab. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;0 skill points

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the skills tab,
Quinn wasn't really able to see much. Everything seemed to be locked
and slightly greyed out, so he quickly moved on to the next tab,
&lt;Shop&gt;. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last tab was the
&lt;Quest&gt; tab. Finally, it seemed like a tab that wasn't locked
behind a requirement. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;Daily Quest:
Drink two litres of water&gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After checking
everything that the system had to offer, Quinn had to just think
about closing the system and it did. When Quinn thought about opening
it again, a screen would immediately pop up in front of him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn could only
think of one thing - The book that his parents had left him was an
ability book. These books could often be bought at very high prices
from the military or a company. Some were even sold on the market
place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the sole
issue was that Quinn had never heard of an ability book that promptly
disappeared, granting the user a system such as the one he currently
had. The ability books were designed to be learnt manually. It wasn't
something that one could pick up and instantly understand how to use.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A smile started to
slowly appear on Quinn's face. This was great news for him. He had
always been a level 1 ability user because he could never afford to
buy any ability books. To his fortune, he had something that he could
use. He readily contemplated on what to do and ended up moving on to
the next phase, which was testing the ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Water bending,
come on!&quot; Quinn said as he raised his right palm forward, acting
like he was going to shoot water out or cause it to flow from the
kitchen sink. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ok next! Wind,
Wind, out!&quot; Quinn did the same again, but there was nothing
happening. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After trying out
many different things according to all the abilities that he had seen
before, it turned out that he was unable to perform any of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell
is this useless thing? Is it really just a system ability?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought about
it for a while. If it truly was like a game, then perhaps, by
completing the quests, he would eventually get stronger and unlock
more skills. It was his mistake that he was treating it like an
ordinary ability book when clearly, what he had obtained wasn't
something that conformed to the word ordinary. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, ability
books were based around one ability. It was important for a person to
select their first ability book since a regular human body would only
be able to perform one ability attribute. If one got transformability
as their first ability, they would only be able to acquire other
skills that were related to this attribute. For example, if someone
obtained fire as their attribute, they could solely dedicate
themselves into gathering skills that the attribute fire could
utilize. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went to open
his mini-fridge, grabbing the bottles of water that were inside. He
soon began downing the water bottles one by one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn, how much
are two litres? My belly feels like it's going to burst.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finishing his
fourth bottle of water, a new notification message had appeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, at least
I know how the system works now,&quot; Quinn said, satisfaction was
evident in his tone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Unanticipatedly, a
loud knock was heard coming from the door. Quinn quickly went and
opened it. As he opened the passageway, standing in front of him was
a large, muscular, bald-headed man wearing a black military uniform.
Also, there were several medals on his garment. His name was written
on the area of the uniform right above his chest - 'Seargent Griff'. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Boy, it is

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With everything that

him today. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's time for

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Due to the war

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of a sudden,
Quinn's body felt extremely sluggish. He felt like he had just gone
on a 5k run and returned without resting. His arms and legs felt
heavier than usual, but there was nothing he could do about it. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn proceeded to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's mood
slightly changed as soon as he saw the new daily quest. Unlike the
one that required him to drink water, this was something that he can
do naturally just by sleeping. If the system worked the same way it
did in games. That meant that once Quinn earned 100 exp points, he
would be able to level up and also increase his stats. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the five
students had heard their names being called, each of them began to
walk their way towards Griff, who was waiting for them in front of
the crowd. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Including Quinn and
Vorden, there was another boy in their group, Peter. Peter looked
more nervous than anyone there. He would constantly look around him
and he couldn't stop fidgeting either. His body frame was quite
small, but it suited him for he wasn't that tall either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When looking at him
it reminded Quinn of himself. A small frame with glasses and scruffy
brown hair. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then, there were the
girls. The first one was named Layla and the other one was Erin.
Layla had short brown hair and a tall figure. On her back, she was
carrying a bow which surprised Quinn, since not many people carried a
weapon these days apart from a specific group of people called the
Pure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They were a group of
people who chose to not have any abilities, and instead, opted to use
weapons. However, they were very rare and Quinn had never met anyone
who belonged in the faction in his life. He had merely heard stories
about them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the third
girl was Erin. Erin was the type of girl whose beauty could make all
of the boys turn their heads on her. Her proportions were perfect,
not too big and not too small, and she had long silky hair that had a
magnificent golden hue. The only problem was her facial expressions.
Even while walking through the gathering of people, not once did her
expression change - It stayed stiff and neutral. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn was walking
past everyone, he noticed that he couldn't recognize any of the
students there and it seemed like the others were not familiar with
anybody either. Quinn could only assume that this was done on
purpose. On top of that, no one knew who to befriend or who to look
out for because currently, everyone's power level displayed 1. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group soon
stopped just behind another group who were being transported to the
testing area. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The moment Vorden
saw the other students who belonged to his group, Vorden greeted each
one of them with a handshake. Vorden was being very polite, so most
of them accepted his greetings apart from Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She merely stared at
Vorden's hand when he offered it to her, turning her gaze away after
a second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, you
don't have to be like that.&quot; Vorden said as he placed his hand
on her shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Regrettably for the
lad, he just made a blunder. In an instant, Erin grabbed Vorden's
wrist and twisted his hand. Specks of ice started to crawl up his
hand as the limb began to freeze. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everyone stopped to
look at the commotion that was happening near the front. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wow, she has
ice abilities?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would let
her freeze me any day.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Several of the
students expressed their amazement in unison. Meanwhile, Griff
noticed the commotion and began to intervene. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Stop it, you
two. If you have that much energy to pick a fight, then save it for
the test.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin immediately
dropped Vorden's hand and slowly, his hand started to defrost. Vorden
then went back in line to stand next to Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can you
believe her?!&quot; Vorden complained, &quot;I nearly lost my hand.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You can't just
go around touching people without their permission,&quot; Quinn
replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I know.
She's lucky I didn't wipe the floor with her just cause she's a
pretty girl.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many people who were
near the front had heard Vorden's word and had already decided to
make him an enemy. One thought formed in their heads - If they could
somehow humiliate Vorden, then maybe Erin would look their way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the
people around them, Quinn could tell what the others were thinking.
Quinn then retreated one step away from Vorden, hoping that others
wouldn't think that the two of them were friends. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At last, Quinn and
the others were called forward and were told to stand inside a
square, drawn with white lines on the ground. The space inside of it
was just big enough to fit the five of them in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One would notice
that outside of the square, there was a hooded man who was standing
nearby. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Send them
away!&quot; Griff said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Griff
gave the command, the hooded man planted both of his hands on the
ground and the square started to light up, shining in a bright purple
colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hmm,
Transportation magic huh. What a rare ability,&quot; Vorden said
right before the whole group suddenly vanished into thin air. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The very next
second, they were teleported to another outdoor area which resembled
an empty wasteland. There was no sign of life nor greeneries, nothing
at all. Standing in front of the group was a woman dressed in a black
military uniform and by her side was another hooded man. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no other
person in sight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The woman held a
Tablet in one of her clutches, appearing as if she was currently busy
inputting some information. Once she had finished, she shifted her
gaze to the students and began to speak. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hello to the
five of you. I am Jane and I will be the one in charge of your test
today. Once the test has been completed, I will be updating your
information and your score will then be reflected on your
wristwatches.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane then reinstated
her eyes on the tablet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, who
should we call first? Oh, it looks like we have a couple of
previously levelled ones?&quot; Jane said as she checked the
information. The information had been passed down from their previous
schools. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Peter, would
you please step forward?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The nervous, small
physiqued Peter did as he was told and he looked even worse than
before. Quinn thought that he appeared unsightly, yet he looked to be
in perfect condition if you were to compare the two. At least Quinn
was able to stand up, whereas Peter looked like he would fall over at
any second. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Would you
please tell me what your ability is, Peter?&quot; Jane asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Eh, I don't
have any ability,&quot; Peter said quietly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Appropriately, Quinn
and the others understood why Peter was so nervous. Having no ability
wasn't rare. Because of the war, many children had become orphans
like Quinn and Peter. This meant that there was no chance for them to
buy an ability book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nevertheless, for
the reason that Peter had no ability, he was afraid of the treatment
that he would get from the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't be
afraid Peter.&quot; Jane said, &quot;Here, take this.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The hooded man, who
was standing beside Jane, suddenly conjured a book in his hand,
allowing it to be taken by Jane. She then handed the book over to
Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wow,
seriously? You're giving this to me for free?!&quot; Peter said with
utter excitement in his voice. &quot;Thank you!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please study
the book in your own free time. When you have finally learned to use
it, you can come back to redo the test, but for now, I'll have to
temporarily award you a level 1 power status.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Peter
had received a level 1 power status, he didn't care about it. At this
moment, he only felt hope. His life could finally turn around due to
the book that he had just received. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now, I believe
that there was another level 1 user here,&quot; Jane said, &quot;Quinn
is it? Would you please step forward.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought the
entire thing was ridiculous. It was quite clear to him that Jane
already had all the information on him from his previous school. They
knew that he never had an ability before, the problem was Quinn was
struggling with deciding what to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before coming to
military school Quinn had done a bit of research himself. He knew
that the military freely gave all students who had no ability their
very own ability book. And each ability book given to them was the
very same one. Each one received an Earth ability book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The reason they did
this was so students who didn't have an ability before, would
suddenly feel indebted to the military. Not only that but the
military also had a hold on nearly all of the Earth type ability
books. Meaning if you ever wanted to increase your strength, you
would have to be loyal to the military, and in return, they would
give you more power. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before Quinn had
discovered his own Ability, he actually thought this was the best
option for him. Even if he didn't want to join the military after two
years, the Earth ability was handy to have. It was easy for
employment because the Earth ability was useful in construction. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was where the
problem came in, Quinn already having an ability meant he was unable
to learn a new one. The ability book that would be given was
practically useless. But not only that, Quinn was pretty sure they
would keep tabs on every student they had given the ability book to,
meaning the teachers would expect him to use earth powers the next
time they saw him. </FONT></FONT>

handed it to Quinn. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn took the book
from Jane at first but then suddenly, a notification screen appeared.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had somewhat
expected the system to display the first message but the second one
truly had surprised him. Quinn was really tempted to take the book
and use it as a form of Exp but he knew there would be questions
asked later on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry, but
I don't want it,&quot; Quinn said as he handed the book back to Jane.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students
watching and the instructor stood there were both shocked. Jane
hadn't experienced anything like this before. In her five years
working as an instructor, it was the first time someone with no
ability had rejected the book. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please give me
one moment.&quot; Jane then stood away from the group of students far
enough so they wouldn't be able to hear anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, yes, he
says he doesn't want the ability book, what should I do?&quot; Jane
asked, speaking on her earpiece. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let him take
the test.&quot; The mysterious man on the phone said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the man hung up,
he couldn't help but think that Quinn was an interesting student. He
began to check on Quinn's file and what he had said seemed to be
true. The student had no ability and didn't seem to have any
relations with the group Pure either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let's see how
long you can survive in this cruel world, Quinn.&quot; The man said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Back at the testing
field, Jane had finished the call with her superior and started to
head back over to the group. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Sorry, for
waiting,&quot; Jane said. &quot;Since you won't be taking the ability
book, we will still require you to take the test please.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought the
whole thing was a joke. If Quinn truly had no ability then they
already knew what the test results were going to be. Was there really
a need for him to take the test? It felt like the only reason they
wanted Quinn to continue was to make him feel humiliated and small.
Eventually, he would then choose to approach the military and beg for
the ability book they were handing out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane then took Quinn
a little further out onto the field where Quinn noticed that there
were huge craters in the ground, burn marks, and all sorts of things.
This was all done from the previous testing contestants. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please proceed
to destroy the targets in front of you as quick as you can.&quot;
Jane said, &quot;The test will begin immediately.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Jane
finished talking, three targets popped up around randomly around the
wasteland. They were metal round targets with a red dot in the
centre. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was when
Quinn tried to look for the targets, everything seemed like a blur in
the distance. Quinn then realized that his perfect eyesight, suddenly
wasn't so perfect. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is this
because I'm out in the sunlight?&quot; Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had no choice
but to slowly run-up to each of the targets and hit them with his
fist one by one, his time was incredibly slow of course. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were then two
further tests that Quinn needed to complete. The next test was a
strength test were Quinn was asked to punch into a huge drum-like
machine. Quinn gave it his best shot and hit the drum as hard as he
could. The drum vibrated and made a small sound eventually displaying
a digital number in the centre. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;5, strength,&quot;
Jane said as she noted it down on her tablet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the final test
had arrived they had brought out another machine. This machine was a
big circular object with many holes on its front. Once the test
started the machine fired holographic spikes at the contestants. All
Quinn needed to do was avoid being hit by the spikes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The machine went up
in levels and eventually got faster and shot out more spikes. In the
end, Quinn managed to get hit by the spikes and the test was stopped.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Agility, 5&quot;
Jane said once again as she noted it down on her tablet </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had heard the
words from Jane's mouth and it started to make him think if there was
some kind of link between the scores she had given him. The last test
was a test of strength and Quinn had scored a 5, similar to his
system which had stated he had 5 strength. Then once again this test
focused on agility and scored a 5 which was the same as his system. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This meant if Quinn
was to take the test at night all of his scores would have most
likely doubled. This also meant as long as he levelled up, he could
always increase his score. It was as if his ability was the ability
to evolve but it also had some drawbacks with it as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As expected,&quot;
Jane said, &quot;Unfortunately your current power level is a level
1.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn clenched his
fist and went back to stand with the others. He knew that the days
ahead of him as a level 1 user would be harsh but that wouldn't be
that way for much longer. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Test continued
with Layla taking the text after him. She was the only one there who
had a weapon on her back. The weapon she had was a bow but it didn't
look like a regular bow, it was different from the ones that people
used a long time ago. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This bow was carved
using parts of a beast. It was black in color and looked almost as if
the entire bow was made of gems. Even the string was made of a
special material. The reason the bow looked so different, was because
it was what was known as a beast weapon. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A bow made from the
body parts of a beast. When the human race was attacked by the Dalki,
our technology advanced fast by replicating their technology, and
with this, the humans learned the ability to travel to other planets

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These planets would
often contain different levels of beasts. The stronger the beast was
the better weapon you could make out of it. It was the first time

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was strange to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla stood in the

was Quinn's turn, they waited until she was ready before starting.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the test
started, 5 targets all appeared in different areas of the wasteland.
Layla immediately took out 5 arrows and placed them in her bow,
shooting them all off at once in the same direction. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In an instant, all

were. Even if you had a weak ability you could make it strong. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wasn't

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On the strength
test, Layla didn't do so well. She used her powers to try to move her

was only an 8. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last test Quinn

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn could tell
Layla wasn't happy, she stomped back as she walked over to the group.
Quinn thought the test wasn't really fair. Her ability level might be

have easily beaten some level 3 or 4 users. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Five random targets
then appeared across the wasteland. She quickly formed an ice spear
and chucked it at the target hitting it dead on. She did this one
after the other at an incredible speed, nearly clearing them all just
as fast as Layla did. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next test Erin
was even more impressive. She started to gather ice in both her palms
and then after a minute or so of gathering her power, a huge ice
column shot out from her hands and hit the centre of the drum dead
on. The drum rang out louder than it had before and the number kept
going up until it had eventually reached 50. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No wonder

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After seeing Vorden
perform well on the test, Quinn couldn't help but think about what
Vorden's ability was. When Vorden went to shake his hand that time,
he said that Vorden had tried to use his ability on Quinn. Yet for
some reason, his ability didn't work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Vorden's ability
was ice, surely his hand would have just frozen. That's unless Quinn
had an ability to block all types of abilities, but that was highly
unlikely. Not only that, but straight after, even Vorden had a
strange reaction, asking Quinn what his ability was; It was as if he
knew his ability didn't work. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then another thought
came into Quinn's mind; why was Vorden so adamant on shaking the
hands of everyone he had just met? If Quinn remembered correctly,
Erin refused to shake Vorden's hand, yet in the end, Vorden still
went to touch Erin on the shoulder. At that time, it seemed like a
weird thing to do, but now Quinn realized it wasn't and everything
was starting to make sense. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Touching was the
condition, and the last person who Quinn touched was Erin. It
couldn't be a coincidence that both of them had the same powers,
which meant most likely that Vorden's ability was the kind to copy
other people's ability. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It didn't work on
Quinn because his ability wasn't straight forward. Quinn couldn't
help his curiosity, so he asked Vorden. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, Vorden is

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden thought that
Quinn was quite amazing, being able to guess something like that just
from a handshake. After all, it was much more likely that Vorden had
obtained the Ice ability from an ability book. The power for copying
wasn't available as an ability book, which only meant one thing. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the test has

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All of a sudden,
everyone started to get chattier, talking to each other as they were

being ignored. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Boring, I can
make anything fun, besides I haven't read a book in…&quot; Vorden
paused for a while. &quot;I can't even remember the last time I read
a book.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
laughed and then Vorden and Quinn decided to head to the library
together. Finally, they had arrived and the first floor was already
busy with students. Quinn noticed that there were multiple round
desks spread out where students were sitting and In the middle of the
desk was a glowing orb. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Ahh, you're
probably wondering what that Orb thing is in the middle aren't you?&quot;
Vorden asked, &quot;It looks like they don't have them at public
schools. If you touch the orb, then it allows you to create a space,
in that space, only those people who have been invited can be heard.
This way people are able to talk and chat as much as they want while
not disturbing others.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Technology
sure has come a long way.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Vorden
then chose a table that had two other people sitting on the other
side. Just as Vorden had said, Quinn could see the two talking but
couldn't hear a word of what they were saying. The orb seemed to only
have a range of the table though. Once you left the table others were
able to hear you as normal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn went looking
around the library and picked out as many books as he could about
abilities. Most of them describing what different types of abilities
the world had. Vorden wasn't too bothered and decided to just select
a random fiction book to read. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two sat at their
tables while Quinn started to flick away. After reading several books
Quinn had discovered nothing new. He already knew about most of the
abilities written in the book but not one of them mentioned an
ability like Quinn's. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had been
keeping a close eye on Quinn and noticed the type of books he had
been picking out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What's with

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought about
it for a while before giving Vorden an answer. Vorden wasn't the
brightest person when it came to academics but he was quite
knowledgeable about abilities it seemed. He would have to be because
of the type of ability he had. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I was trying

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh right, I
forgot about that, I thought you might have been one of those Pure
members who hate abilities. Turns out you just didn't want to be a

anything specific you're looking for?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not really, I
have no clue. There was one that said something interesting though,
have you ever heard of an ability that is weaker in sunlight.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden suddenly
started to laugh out loud. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
crazy, I've never heard of something like that. Abilities are
something our bodies learn. Sure some people have limits and can't
learn stronger spells or can do less than others but for one to get
weaker because of the sun. Sounds like you're a Vampire or
something.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn felt a little
embarrassed by Vorden's reaction. Of course, Quinn knew this would be
the normal reaction when asking something like this but it was true.
As long as Quinn was in direct sunlight all of his stats would weaken
by half. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn continued to
look around the library to see if there was anything else he could
find. He had finally gone through every single one of the ability
books he could find but there was nothing. Quinn then looked up at
the floor above where there were some second-year students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe there's
something up there but I can't imagine what the academy would do to
me for breaking the rules.&quot; Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn continued
to walk around the library, he had eventually ventured into the
fiction section and his eyes were drawn to something. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A specific title of
a book named &quot;The Truth about Vampires.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn took out the
book and gave it a quick look. Vampires were things of fairy tales,
myths even. Even when people started to come out with powers, there
was not one person who came out claiming to be a vampire. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn couldn't help
himself but start to read the book. It was a long shot but maybe he
would find something he could relate to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After reading and
skimming through the book, Quinn found most of it was useless. A lot
of the things that Vampires did, didn't relate to him at all.
Vampires were required to eat human blood. Some could transform
themselves into bats and cast illusions. While others were incredibly
skilled with the sword and hypnosis but Quinn had none of these
things. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing he
could relate to in the book was being weaker in the sun. Eventually,
Quinn decided to close the book and call it a day. It didn't seem
like he was going to find anything from the first floor of the
library. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He immediately had
to test it out, after reading several different books about

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Quinn
theorized that after reading all the books, he had gained so much

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as he was

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, Quinn

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student stood
opposite Quinn was still holding his hands suspiciously behind his
back. Even without the help of the system, Quinn could tell the
student was obviously hiding his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, what
happened to your big balls?&quot; the student said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think you're
playing with them behind your back,&quot; Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That immediately
angered the student which was what Quinn was going for. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You weak piece
of garbage!&quot; the student came charging forward and slashed his
hand out at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily Quinn's
reflexes were fast and he managed to lift his arm in time to block
the attack and move back a little. However, the student's hand
managed to slice right through the skin of Quinn's arm and caused
blood to be drawn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
student who now had his hands out in view. The student had a
transformation ability that was limited to only his hands. They
caused them to slightly resemble a tiger claw and hardened his
fingernails. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn was
able to block the attack in time, the claw managed to still rip
through his skin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is the system
saying if I take four more attacks like that, I'm dead?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly everything
became a little bit more serious for Quinn. The stinging pain he was
feeling on his arm was real and this was a real fight. The game-like
system had caused him to take things a little too easy. But he was
quickly reminded that this wasn't a game. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student then
immediately started to charge at Quinn once again with his claw-like
hands. As the student swung his right-hand Quinn managed to duck and
throw a punch of his own into the student's stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell,
this guy hits hard!&quot; The student thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student didn't
quit there though and decided to strike at Quinn's open back causing
another claw mark to appear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Shut up I
know!&quot; Quinn shouted as he lifted the student using both of his
hands by the legs and threw up against the side of the wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How did Quinn
manage to pick him up like that?&quot; Peter thought, &quot;There
roughly about the same size and he threw him with ease, does he
really not have an ability?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't stop
there though. It was important for him to teach people like them a
lesson, otherwise, they would just come back for more. Quinn needed
to show him to never mess with him again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn ran up to the
student who was lying and the floor and kicked him in the stomach
with full force. The kick was so hard that it caused the student to
cough up a little bit of blood from his mouth. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the student
suddenly started coughing some more. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, but if he
attacks us again, he's going to wish he was.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was actually
quite relieved. He didn't know what the punishment was at the academy
for killing another student, even if he explained that he hadn't
attacked first. He also didn't want the burden of death on his
shoulders at such a young age, so he was happy when the system had
rewarded him the experience points, without having the need to kill
the student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then suddenly
another message had appeared. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Excitement started
to fill Quinn's mind as he had finally received his first skill.
Quinn was hoping maybe this would help him figure out what type of
ability he had but the name of it didn't sound too promising. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Inspect? So
maybe it can tell me the weaknesses of my opponents?&quot; Quinn
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then decided
to test his new ability out and looked at Peter who was standing next
to him. Now was the next problem. Quinn had no idea how to use his
skill but the moment he started thinking about the skill &quot;Inspect.&quot;
The skill had activated on its own and a screen had appeared right
next to Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
information that had been given to him and it seemed like there were
some sections blanked out. Quinn could only assume this was because
the level of his skill was still only at level 1 but the information
it did give him, was quite handy. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It told Quinn what
type of ability they had which would be very useful in a fight, it
also told Quinn how much health they had. However, there was one bit
of information that Quinn found strange and that was the Blood type.
It was weird for the system to give him information about such a
specific thing and Quinn also wondered how on earth would this ever
help him in the future. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went up
to the Student who was still laying on the ground in pain and used
the inspect skill on him. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Checking the status
of Kyle made Quinn learn a few new things. The information he was
given about the ability, only gave him the type of ability. There
were hundreds of different transformation abilities so it wasn't able
to pinpoint it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other thing was
the HP, It looked like for his victory he only needed to bring down
the students HP to 1 but Quinn still didn't know if 0 meant death or
not. It could also just mean the person had been knocked out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While looking in the

looked slow, in reality, it was incredibly fast. For someone to be
able to actually witness his skin scabbing over and healing was an
amazing sight. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had actually

back to the dorms there was one more thing he wanted to do and that
was to head to the training room that they had been shown while

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was getting late

reached the training room in the academy. It was a large oval

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were giant
mech robots, shooting targets, and things Quinn had no idea what they
even did but what Quinn wanted to see most of all, was the power
level testing equipment. Inside the training centre, Quinn had also
spotted the same machinery that was used at the testing field. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn walked over to

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had also come
to the training room late at night and before Quinn had entered, she
had been testing out her bow and arrow skills, practicing. She always
practiced at night when she was nervous and she couldn't help but
worry about tomorrow. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was when she
suddenly heard the doors open to the training room, being her shy

noticed something. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He swung his fist
back and prepared to hit the drum as hard as possible. A number
appeared on the drum and the number slowly started to rise until it
eventually stopped at 10. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Seems like I

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had a theory
after hearing his test scores that his status screen stats also
matched the equipment the school used. Although this was only a
theory, Quinn wanted to test it out for himself. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn next went to
the hologram spike machine. Last time Quinn managed to last ten
seconds against the machine before it got too fast for him to dodge
the attacks. If his theory was right, he should at least be able to
last twenty seconds now that his stats were no longer halved. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, Layla who
had been watching this whole time had seen everything. She couldn't
understand why a student would hide his strength in the school. A low

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were no set

waiting in line with Peter and Vorden they noticed a student come

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Because it
works in their favour.&quot; Quinn replied, &quot;The strong bullying
the weak causes the weak to go on the path to find more power, but if

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look, I
understand Vorden that you might think you are helping me and Peter
but maybe you don't understand because you've never been powerless

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn hated to
saying this to Vorden, after all, Vorden was the first person who has

Vorden's presence had helped. Whenever Quinn and Peter walked around
the higher levels did nothing to them because of Vorden. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although it looked
like Vorden had stormed off in anger due to Quinn's words, that

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had been
tracking Quinn and the others for a while now, she was even there
when Quinn was busy dealing with Mono. Although she didn't plan to
help out or anything, she was just amazed that Quinn was able to
attract so much attention in one day. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The only thing that
Layla was confused about was why did Quinn's punch seem so weak and
slow. From the looks of things, it seemed like Quinn really did want
to punch Mono but that defiantly wasn't his best from what she had
seen at the training centre. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Vorden had
stormed off, Peter and Quinn decided that it would be best that they
head back to class for their next lesson. They walked for a while but
just before they got back to the first-year building, a group of
first-year students were standing in front of the staircase. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

One of the boys said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I know, why

Another boy replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Credits were the
School's and city's currency system. Even though they were at
military school, the rest of the city functioned as normal. There
were still restaurants and shops and even fun activities and games to
play all around the city. If you wanted to do these things you would
have to pay with credits. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Students received

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was hoping

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I think I

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter looked at
Quinn with hope in his eyes, perhaps thinking that Quinn might have
been able to do something like last time but after trying to hit
Mono, he knew he would have no chance. Besides, these were level twos

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn decided that
it would be better off to just hand over the credits anyway. It was
better than losing a fight and forcing the credits over. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then Quinn

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, Quinn
wanted to test out his chances. The idea of gaining additional exp
and levelling up even further became really attractive to him but
Quinn wouldn't let his greed win him over. Right now there were three

of them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing
Quinn needed to do was get inside so he could use his inspect skill

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Quinn
decided to hand over the ten credits, He placed his watch on the
other boys and the credits were transferred over. Peter ended up
doing the same and the two of them were allowed to enter the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey that was a

out here until we find someone weaker again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What!&quot;
Quinn said in his head, he was hoping that once they had paid them,
the boys would enter the building but it looked like they were going
to hang outside for a while. Quinn suddenly stopped and waited. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn clenched
his fist and shouted. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All three boys
turned their heads at the same time but not one of them replied.
Quinn bad luck continued but he had one more plan to find out which
one of them was Rylee. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that Quinn left
Peter and Vorden on their own while Quinn rushed off to the
convenience store. The convenience store wasn't too far away from
military school. If you walked out, it would take you around 20

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the front of the
school was a huge gate that had two guards stood at the entrance at

required to show their wristwatch to the guard and same upon entering
again. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once past the gates,
Quinn decided to test out how much ten stamina points really was. He
started to jog at a relatively fast pace to the convenience store.
After running for about 5 minutes he realized that he wasn't out of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The stats given to
him were that of an athlete's body, it wasn't the same weak body he

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another thing he
noticed while running at night, he could see everything super clear.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn charged in

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a thought came
into Quinn's mind. If Rylee was able to harden his body then why
didn't he just keep it hardened all the time? If he did then Quinn's
first attack wouldn't have gone through. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Did this mean that

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had to take a
few steps back and took a minute to take everything in. He couldn't
believe what he was reading right now. After seeing that last message
there was only one thing that came into his head. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Maybe Quinn was just
trying to avoid the truth this whole time but this was the finale
thing to confirm it. He had his suspicion after reading the book, but
everything was adding up, him being weaker in the sun, his night
vision, and the fact the system wanted him to drink blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now it was
telling him that he would have to drink blood otherwise he would die.
With other things, there were many other creatures in folklore that
were affected by them. But only one stood out in particular when
talking about consuming human blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn stood there
looking down at Rylee who was passed out lying on the ground. It
seemed like a perfect opportunity for him to complete his quest. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He gulped his saliva
down as spit was starting to fill his mouth, for some reason
something was drawing him to Rylee's body. Without realizing it, he
was slowly moving forward and suddenly he could see Rylee's pulse
beating through his neck. The blood flowing through his veins. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'How am I even meant

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were so many

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had continued
to watch Quinn since he left the convenience store. When she saw
Quinn following Rylee and him holding the mask, she had an idea of
what he was planning to do. She kept a safe distance back while
staying in between the trees to avoid being seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when she saw
the whole thing. She saw Quinn put on the mask and beat Rylee to the
ground but then she was wondering what he was doing. She saw him
kneeling on the floor as if he looked to be in pain, and now, he was
looking at Rylee very strangely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next second she

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn continued to
lift Rylee of the ground and place him back down again as he was
deciding on what to do. His mind continued to go back and forth. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Damn it, in
the movies it so much easier.&quot; Quinn said, &quot;The idea of
sticking my teeth into someone, I just can't do it. Maybe I can just
make a small cut on his arm.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Trying to confirm if
what she was seeing was real. Layla started to slowly creep about
closer through the bushes and trees, then suddenly, her foot had
landed on a small twig and a snapping sound was heard. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What was that
?&quot; Quinn thought as he turned and looked around, but could see
no one. However, in a panic that someone was coming his way and would
find him, he left the body where it was and headed back to school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla was unaware of
the small twig she had stepped on and snapped. She hadn't even heard
the sound herself. in her eyes, she just saw Quinn suddenly leave. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wonder what
that was all about, in the end, he didn't do anything?&quot; Layla
thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
head back to school and placed the mask back in his shopping bag. He
noticed that the ice cream he had bought had melted but for some
reason when he looked at it, in no longer looked appetizing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was a hunger
in his stomach that he knew wouldn't be satisfied with food and he
wondered just how long he would be able to hold it in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn had
finally arrived back at school, he decided to stop by the toilet
first. Quinn was looking at himself in the mirror to see if there
were any noticeable changes but Quinn looked the same as before. Then
Quinn lifted up his lips so he could get a better view of his teeth
but they too had stayed the same. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Phew, at least
it looks like no one will be able to tell. I wonder why I felt pain
in my teeth at the time then?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then decided
to open his status screen to see if there were any differences from
before now that he had levelled up and evolved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's health had
increased by 50 percent while everything else seemed to have remained
the same. To be honest, Quinn was pretty bumped out about that but
just underneath he could see that there was a single attribute point.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn pressed
on the system it would allow him to increase his strength, Agility or
Stamina by one point. Quinn thought about it for a while and decided
to add a point to his Agility. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Quinn
wanted to put it into strength in case he met more people like Rylee,
he thought he could overcome that problem with a good beast weapon
and would just be a waste of stats. What he wanted right now was to
be able to be fast and agile like an assassin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wondered if
there was a reason why the system had only given him one point, then
he started to remember the additional quest that it had given him. As
long as Quinn consumed the blood of his victim, it would give him a
stat point. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far Quinn would
have been able to have an additional two stat points while levelling
up only gave him one. If Quinn wanted to get stronger then this would
be the quickest way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn was unsure
on whether or not he would be able to do it, he needed to try to do
more research into the system and see if there was anything he could
find out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He had a direction
now and knew his system was similar to that of a vampire. Perhaps if
he learned more about them he would be able to figure out if there
was a way around drinking the blood as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, Quinn
decided to head to his room where he could hear Vorden and Peter
practising together. Peter was trying his best to learn the skill
book the military had given him, while Vorden was tutoring him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What took you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, I just

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the group
turned off the lights and went to sleep. All except for one person
that is. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was unable to
sleep, his stomach was in a tremendous amount of pain and he had too
much on his mind. If what the message said was true Quinn didn't have
enough time to solve his problem. However, there was nothing he could
do. The school had a curfew of 10 PM and if you were caught outside
that curfew there would be major punishments. So all Quinn could do
was try to get some sleep and deal with the problem in the morning. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When he woke up the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything that
happened so far was a miscalculation on Quinn's part. Although the
system had told him he would lose 1 hp every hour, he didn't expect
his body to react like this. Originally, he only planned to sleep for
five hours as he was too worn out after the fight yesterday. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That way he would
still have at least ten hours and a few hours in the morning before
classes started. Quinn started to calculate how much time he had
left. Breakfast was a requirement which lasted from 8 till 9, then
classes went on till 12 midday for lunch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That meant there
were four more hours where he was required to be somewhere in the
school. Of course, there was always the option of skipping, but this
wasn't like regular school. The army would severely punish you and
hunt you down if you did. But what did that matter if he was going to
die anyway? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was currently
in the canteen queue to be served some food. He was breathing in deep
breaths and in and out slowly, it was helping him get the hang of his
heightened senses. He could hear the conversation from the other side
of the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Pots and pans
clanging in the kitchen as if they were next to him. Slowly Quinn was
figuring out how to ignore all these and it was making his mind think
clearer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then though,
Rylee had entered the canteen. He had no markings on his body from
the fight yesterday as he had managed to make a full recovery at the
medical centre but he was in a terrible mood after what had happened
yesterday. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as he saw
Quinn, he had found a target to take out all his pent-up frustration
on. Rylee walked past all the level ones that were in the queue until
he eventually reached the spot were Quinn was standing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey Pipsqueak,
you got a problem if I cut Infront of you?&quot; Rylee asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn was too
busy trying to focus the sounds out from his mind. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
ignoring me? Today is not the day to ignore me.&quot; Rylee looked at
Quinn's wristwatch seeing the number 1 shine bright on it.
Immediately bad memories of yesterdays fight had come into his head
and how all he wanted to do was kill the person but that would have
to wait for now and Quinn would have to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I said don't
ignore me?&quot; Rylee said as he grabbed Quinn by the collar. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But in that instant,
Rylee's face was incredibly close to Quinn's. Quinn could hear
Rylee's heartbeat. He could feel the blood flowing through his arm
and muscles lifting his shirt. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Something had taken
over Quinn's body and he immediately hit Rylee's arm away and pounced
on him causing the two of them to fall to the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was now on top
of Rylee and had both his hands pinned down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Get off me you
crazy animal!&quot; Rylee said but when Rylee tried to overpower
Quinn and lift his hands, it was impossible. Even his Ability was
useless in this situation. His ability only hardened his skin, it
didn't make him any more powerful. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn started
to feel something growing in his mouth. Quinn placed his head just a
few inches away from Rylee's neck and was ready. Just as Quinn opened
his mouth though, he felt someone pull him by the back of his collar
and chucked him off Rylee towards the people in the queue. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't touch
one of my boys,&quot; Dan said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Dan was a large man
for his age with a muscular build. He didn't look like a teenage boy
but more like a bald adult. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Dan, thank you
so much,&quot; Rylee said as he stood up from the ground sweating.
&quot;You're dead now boy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Dan took
one step forward though, Vorden stepped Infront of Quinn with Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you really
want to cause a problem,&quot; Vorden said lifting his arm to show
the power level on his wristwatch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The truth was,
Vorden was only bluffing. Vorden's power very much depended on what
ability he copied and right now all he had was Peter's level 1 earth
ability. If they were to get into a fight here, there was no contest
on who would win. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Vorden's plan
seemed to work as Dan decided to back down and take Rylee with him
but before Rylee walked off, he signalled to Quinn imitating someone
cutting his head off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, thank you,
thank you, I can't believe that worked,&quot; Peter said knowing
Vorden's secret. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the canteen
incident was over, something became clear to Quinn. That teaches
wouldn't step in no matter what happened. In the canteen there were
many guards standing in each corner of the room but not once did they
step in to help. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the group
finished eating it was time for them to go to their morning classes
but Quinn was unable to concentrate on anything, all he could do was
try to calm himself down while in the middle of class and watch his
HP slowly tick away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was driving him
insane seeing the number go down hour by hour and now wished he had
just bitten into Rylee's neck yesterday. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when it came to
lunchtime, Quinn once again rushed off without Vorden and Peter this
time to the library. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell
is happening to me?&quot; Quinn said as his hands wouldn't stop
shaking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each time Quinn's HP
would go down, it was getting harder and harder to control his own
body and sooner or later he would go crazy. During class, he had
multiple visions of tearing the place apart and ripping out the blood
from their necks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without realising
where he was walking to, Quinn eventually ended up in the library. In
the quiet corner of the library down one of the isles was the fiction
section. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please have
something I can use,&quot; Quinn said as he took out fantasy book
after fantasy book about Vampires. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In some of the
books, Vampires were able to live off animal blood, But Quinn's
system clearly stated he needed human blood. Not just that but it
would be hard for him to find an animal in time. In other stories,
there were talks of going to the hospital and raiding their supply
but the hospital in the city was heavily guarded and he didn't have
time for that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, for the
first time, Quinn could feel himself getting weaker. He sat on the
floor and read one last book and found nothing of use. When he closed
the book, he could see Layla standing there opposite him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;
Layla asked concerned for Quinn as he was starting to look very pale.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then bent down
so she was at eye level with Quinn and placed her hand on his
forehead to check his temperature. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're so

asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn replied with
one word. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thankfully Quinn

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But this time he
would get blood beforehand, so he would be better prepared. But

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn walked
down the hallway, he got quite a few looks from the other students,
it wasn't strange to see someone carry an injured person in the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, Quinn had
reached the infirmary, where there was a single female doctor named
Hayley, who looked to be in her early thirties. She wore round
glasses and had her hair up in a ponytail. Quinn never got the chance
to mess around with girls while he was at school but looking at the
doctor, he couldn't help but appreciate her natural beauty. </FONT></FONT>

there.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn did as he was
told and placed Layla gently on one of the single beds in the back.
The infirmary was quite large, Quinn had never seen a school have one
so big. There was a total of 30 beds but Hayley was the only one
working there. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the moment about
half the beds were filled up with students and Quinn couldn't help
but notice most of them were low levels. There were the odd high
levels as well. Even they got into their own fights and
disagreements. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley came over to
where Quinn and Layla were and started to examine Layla. She placed
her hand around her Wrist and did a few other checks. That's when she
noticed the two small hole marks on her neck. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not sure,
I was in the library when I saw her on the ground like that,&quot;
Quinn replied. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know
how long she was passed out for but the wound on her neck looks like
it's already healing on its own.&quot; Hayley said, &quot;Still I
can't be sure if it will heal and it would be a shame if a pretty
girl like her got a scar.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley then placed
her hand on Layla's neck where the bite marks were. She closed her
eyes and after a few seconds, lifted her hands and the bite marks had
vanished. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After sucking
Layla's blood, it seemed like he had gained a stat point. Quinn
remembered after defeating opponents the system would give him an
additional quest to suck his victim's blood. The reward was a stat
point but it seemed like there was no need for him to get a quest. </FONT></FONT>

decided to look around the room, until he finally found what he was
looking for, a syringe with a needle. Quinn looked around the room
and saw that Hayley was busy dealing with another student. He
carefully took the syringe and hid it behind his back and then
quickly scooted over to where Layla was once more. </FONT></FONT>

Peter replied. &quot;Me and Vorden were busy messing around
practising my earth ability together, that's when a bunch of second
years I'd never seen before came up to us asking for Vorden. Vorden
told me not to worry but of course, I worried so I followed them.
That's when I saw them take him to the assembly hall but two of the
students stood guard and wouldn't let me come inside. I didn't know
what to do, so that's when I came looking for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly Quinn felt

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When images of what
had happened to Layla started flashing through her head, she
immediately started to get this tingling feeling over her body. She
was reacting to the memories of Quinn biting into her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't a painful
memory but quite an addictive feeling. The sensation of the blood
rushing through her body. Her face was starting to turn a little red
just thinking about it. That's when she lifted her hand and placed it
on her neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Huh, I can't
feel anything?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, so you're
awake,&quot; Haley said with a smile. &quot;You were sleeping so
peacefully there I didn't know when you were going to wake up.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How did I get
here?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh a boy came
in and dropped you off, he said he was your friend, I can't remember
his name but he had short black curly hair,&quot; Hayley said with a
smile thinking about the tow of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This confirmed
Layla's thought. Quinn must have brought her here right after biting
her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Hayley then noticed
that Layla was rubbing the side of her neck with her hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I got rid
of those two marks for you, do you remember what happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again as she
thought back to the memory of Quinn biting her, she started to get
goose bumps all over her body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm not sure
maybe it was a beast?&quot; Layla replied </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I here
sometimes a stray can come out with the students while they're
training through the portals,&quot; Layla said nervously hoping that
Hayley would believe her lie. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well whatever
it was, I'm sure someone else will deal with it, it's just a good
thing your safe now.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was running
through the school halls as fast as he could, he needed to make it to
the doctor's office before Layla woke up. He had no idea how Layla
would react, not only that but what were the consequences of biting
someone? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If it was like some
of the Vampire Novels Quinn had read in the library, some vampires
had the ability to turn others. Right now, Quinn thought that might
be a better situation than everyone finding out about his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, Quinn had
reached the doctor's office and he pulled the door wide open. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh hello
again,&quot; Hayley said. &quot;If you're looking for the girl you
just missed her, she left a little while ago.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Really? Did
she happen to say anything?&quot; Quinn asked, judging by Haley's
reaction it didn't seem like Layla had said anything but he needed to
make sure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh you mean
about the wound, she said that a beast might have attacked her,
although I highly doubt that, it looked more like snake bite but how
did it manage to get into the school and all the way up her neck.&quot;
Hayley continued to ramble on. She often did this as she was left on
her own a lot of the times being the only doctor stationed at the
school. It was a lonely Job. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thanks for
letting me know,&quot; Quinn said as he closed the door. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Why did Layla decide
to keep it a secret Quinn thought? He had basically assaulted the
poor girl, good it be that she didn't remember what happened or maybe
she was planning to use at blackmail against him but that didn't make
sense, she had nothing to gain. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had always
thought like this, people when they did something, always did it for
selfish reasons, that's just the way people were. He couldn't believe
that Layla would keep this a secret for no reason. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then while
Quinn was outside the doctor's office thinking of what to do next. He
felt a hand on his shoulder. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You and me, we
need to talk,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Had she been waiting
here this whole time, this was bad. Layla clearly indicated that she
knew something which meant losing her memory of the events where
unlikely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
headed to the library where then incident took place. Quinn felt a
bit more relaxed, taking him here meant she wasn't looking for a
fight as there were other students in the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them sat
at a table and activated the Orb so only the two of them could be
heard. As they looked into each other's eyes for a bit, Quinn started
to run multiple scenarios through his head. If worst came to worst,
he might have to silence her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What happened
at the library, what did you do?&quot; Layla asked rubbing her neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why bother
asking if you already know what happened?&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Just
tell me what you want?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know
if you know this but I kept an eye on you for longer than you think,
after observing you for a while a came to a conclusion. You're a
Vampire, aren't you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
laugh nervously hoping to throw Layla of track. He was actually
amazed by how she had come to the conclusion so fast when it even
took him a while. Even if she did see everything, he had done so far
he didn't think this was the natural conclusion someone would come
to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And why would
you think that?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I saw you
lifting, that boy's neck, at the time I thought you doing something
else cause I couldn't see clearly,&quot; Layla said as her ears
started to heat up a little. &quot;But after what you had done to me,
it confirms it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
sweat slightly at the integration. He wasn't worried about Layla
herself but the troubles she could bring him in the future. Quinn
didn't know what to say and thought he would wait for Layla to make
her demand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then took a
deep breath before saying her next words. This is what Quinn was
waiting for, her request. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I want you to
hear me out. I want you to make me a Vampire.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was so shocked
by the words that had come out of Layla's mouth that he nearly fell
out of his seat. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, do you
realise what you are saying right now?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please,&quot;
Layla said as if she was begging him. &quot;It's a childhood dream of
mine, this type of things only happens in books or fairy tales and
now I have the chance for it to happen right now.&quot; She said with
her eyes lit up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now Quinn realised

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You know what
that means right?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla nodded. Quinn
was basically telling her it was impossible for him to give her this
ability. The reason was a human body could only activate one ability.
When learning an ability, it mutated the genes inside of your body
but once your genes had been mutated, they could no longer change or
add a second mutation. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because Layla
already had the ability of telekinesis, it meant Layla was unable to
learn a second ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then why did
you hide this from the academy, why did you tell them you had no
ability. If you got this from an ability book you can't be an
original?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Have you ever
heard of an ability like this?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla thought about
for a while and realised there was nothing quite like it. There was
never a record of an ability requiring someone to drink blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But if you
told the school you got it from an ability book, one that's not even
been registered and you aren't an original, you could make a fortune
selling the book!&quot; Layla said excitedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I wish that
was true but I can't do that either,&quot; Quinn explained. &quot;When
I learnt the ability the book simply vanished.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla was debating
whether Quinn was telling the truth or not but she had no choice but
to believe him. It was the only explanation of why Quinn was so
adamant in hiding his ability. Ability books didn't just vanish they
were books. They could be passed on for others to learn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If people found out
about this, multiple companies and the military would put immense
pressure on Quinn to share the ability with the world and with no
powerful family backing him, Layla couldn't imagine what would be
done to him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They would never
believe him if he said he got it from an ability book and it
disappeared. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then proceeded
to tell Layla about everything that had happened so far. But left out
the details about the game like system. Only stating that he
continued on as normal when suddenly, he had this incurable hunger.
Layla felt like it was a mixture of things she had read about
vampires before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't die in
the sun but felt incredibly weak she was just as interested to learn
more about his vampire like ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, I will
keep this as a secret but only on one condition. I want you to help
you out.&quot; Layla said. &quot;Clearly you don't know much about
this thing, so much so that you had gone out of control and bit me in
the neck. We can't have you going around school biting people.
They'll take you away in a heartbeat. If you need to feast on
someone, then feast on me.&quot; Layla said placing her hand on
herself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
think about the situation, having Layla as a helper was a big
advantage. Quinn himself wanted to test multiple things about the
system and here he had someone offering to help for free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And it truly felt
like Layla was telling the truth. Not only that but Layla seemed to
be more knowledgeable about vampires then himself. Perhaps she would
even be able to help him in his research. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's a deal,&quot;
Quinn said as the two of them shook hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla was happy that
Quinn had accepted. The truth was Layla still hadn't given up the
idea of being a Vampire. Unlike Quinn, Layla wasn't too sure that
what Quinn had was an ability in the first place. An ability was
usually a specific set of skills but Quinn had completely changed as
if he was no longer human. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright, the
first thing is first, you going to need to take some of my blood.&quot;
Layla said, &quot;That way if you're getting hungry again, you can
drink some of that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla then pulled
down her shirt slightly and started to show her neck towards Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
thinking, we can't do it here in front of the library and I'm not
just going to bite into your neck.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the two continued
to talk and chat about things in the library about what to do next. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden had entered
the library and could see Quinn talking to Layla, both chatting and
smiling away. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Have you

mine and I'm not letting anyone hurt you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was currently
running around the school looking for Quinn or Vorden. For some
reason, both of his new friends had suddenly started acting very
strange and Peter didn't know what to do about it. His life at his
previous school had been hell and he did everything he could to serve
those above him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And for the first
time ever he had made friends that protected him. Quinn, even though
he was a low level himself had stood up for Peter and Vorden who had
not only protected him but helped him learn his new ability.
Something had happened to Vorden and suddenly he was acting strange. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Peter had
no clue what was going on with Quinn, he had some idea about what had
changed Vorden. It was after whatever had happened at the assembly
hall with the second-year students. But no matter who he would talk
to about it, not one person would give him an answer. Some even begin
to threaten him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when Peter
could hear a familiar voice. While walking down the hallway Peter
could hear someone speaking, a voice he recognised. As he turned the
corner, he saw that is was indeed Vorden. Vorden stood there staring
idly at the ground. Peter quickly hid back around the hallway corner.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far whenever
Peter had spotted Vorden, he would just ignore him and walk away
without even speaking to him but now it sounded like Vorden was
speaking to someone else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Would you two
calm down,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was then a
brief pause before Vorden spoke again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't care
if he hurt the little one's feelings, it's not like Quinn isn't
allowed to talk to other people.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Again, there was a
slight pause. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look if you
get involved and hurt them, I won't forgive you. I won't let
something like last time happen again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The whole time Peter
was listening in to the conversation the only voice he could hear was
Vorden's but it was clear that he was speaking to someone. Peter
couldn't take it anymore and decided to take a peak and as he did
still the only person he could see was Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Did the other
person leave already?&quot; Peter thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then he saw
Vorden start to walk off. The bell had rung indicating that it was
the end of their lunch break and it was time to head to afternoon
classes. That's when the library doors opened and Quinn and Layla
appeared out walking together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn!&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'll meet you

Layla before leaving to join Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
started to walk off to class together. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, are you
okay man?&quot; Peter asked. &quot;I was worried about you when you
suddenly bolted out of the room like that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah sorry
man, I couldn't hold it in any longer otherwise my underwear would
have turned brown.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Woah, whoa too
much information,&quot; Peter said. &quot;Anyway, I'm glad you're
okay, look I'm really worried about Vorden. Ever since he came back
from that assembly hall, he's been acting strange.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn placed his
hand on Peter seeing that he was clearly startled. This whole time
Quinn had more important things to worry about but now that he had
solved the most pressing matter, he had time to focus on other
things. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't worry,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they entered
their next class, they could see that Vorden was already in his seat
sat down, ready even before them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh hey guys,
how you doing?&quot; Vorden said with a smile. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter went to sit in

to the left of Vorden. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, are you
feeling better?&quot; Peter asked, &quot;Earlier it seemed like you
were kinda sulking.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah don't
worry, I just got kinda thrown around a bit by the second years and
it got me pretty down,&quot; Vorden replied. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What happened
at the assembly hall?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Vorden's face
slightly changed, it was as if he was trying to hold something back.
Vorden clenched his fist for a few seconds and finally relaxed his
hand. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All though Peter was
quite satisfied now with Vorden, as he seemed to be his regular self,

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As other students

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the students sat
down the talks continued and several different words could be heard.
Monster, Freak, weirdo, crazy, and all these words were being aimed
at Vorden. It was as if the whole school was sharing a secret that
Peter and Quinn weren't allowed to know and not even Vorden himself
would say what had happened. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After hearing these

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After classes had
finished for the Day, Vorden had offered to help Peter with his
training again. Especially since tomorrow the two of them would be in
the same combat classes, the elemental class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
want to come with us?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nah, I won't
bother you guys, I wouldn't be much help anyway,&quot; Quinn replied.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter was pleased
that it seemed like the group had gotten back normal again. There was
no tension between the three of them and Peter whished it would stay
that way forever. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then when Quinn
had left, Vorden and Peter were left in the room, that's when Vorden
asked Peter a question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, have you
seen Quinn hanging around with a girl lately?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come to think
of it, I saw him exit with a girl at the library. It was the same one
who was at the test with us that day, with the bow and arrow.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Peter had
given an answer, for a split-second, Peter felt like he saw the
expression on Vorden's face change. But Quinn blinked and looked
again and Vorden seemed to be fine. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe he's
gone and got himself a little girlfriend.&quot; Said Vorden laughing.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had, of
course, decided to ditch the other two because he had already made
plans to meet up with Layla beforehand. The two of them were to meet
at the school gate. But before the two of them were to meet, Quinn
decided to stop by the science lab. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although most
lessons in military school were about combat or how to use
technology, science was still a core subject. It was because of
scientist that the human race had discovered how to use all the
different technologies they had in the world today. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So students were
encouraged to continue to learn science throughout their service
time, in hopes they would continue to in the future. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The classrooms where
empty for the day and the important equipment were locked in a
storage room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn wasn't
looking for anything too fancy, all he needed was some test tubes and
small corks. After searching around the room for a while he found
where they kept the test tubes. He took a total of five test tubes </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though there
were many there, if he took too much it would be suspicious and Quinn
couldn't carry more than five without having to worry about them
breaking or not. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn shoved the
five test tubes into a messenger bag he was carrying and wrapped them
up in a spare shirt he took from his room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn currently had
a total of 60/200 Exp until his next level up. 50 experience points
had carried over from the last quest and he had received ten exp from
his two daily quests. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So far with each
level up, he would gain one additional stat point and five points of
HP. Although Quinn had gotten stronger through this. It wasn't the
fastest way for him to improve his strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn realised the
system had offered him the chance to gain an additional stat point
two times as long as he drank his victim's blood but when he drank
Layla's blood, he still gained a stat point. This was what Quinn
wanted to test out today. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was 6 o'clock in
the evening and the sun was just starting to set, meaning Quinn
wasn't affected by the sun right now. As planned Layla was standing
there waiting for him by the gate with her bow on her back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Students who used
weapons would carry it with them around most of the time. There was
always the chance of an attack or a beast escaping through a portal. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the two of
them met, they decided to walk to the nearby park that was in between
the convenience store and the school. Then they ventured away from
the trail into the woods where they were behind cover. No one
ventured in these parts and it was hard for them to be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So are we
going to this?&quot; Layla asked excitedly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn still found it
weird that rather than being scared by the whole situation, Layla was
exited. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright close
your eyes.&quot; Said Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla closed her
eyes and was ready. She could still remember the satisfying feeling
from the last time and couldn't wait to feel it again. Although she
was a bit nervous when a thought came to her head that Quinn's lips
would be on her neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly though,
Layla felt a small prick in her arm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla opened her
eyes and noticed that a needle was there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What? You
didn't think I was just going to bite you, did you?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla's cheeks
suddenly went bright red. If it wasn't for the needle in her hand,
she would have tried kicking Quinn away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once the syringe had
been filled up, Quinn squirted it out into one of the test tubes he
brought with him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is it okay if
I fill another one,&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla didn't say
anything and held out her arm, she was still a bit embarrassed about
what had happened earlier. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once Quinn had
filled up two test tubes, he put one of the blood-filled tubes in his
bag while holding the other. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then looked at
Layla and used his inspect Skill once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was as Quinn
thought. When using the inspect skill on the blood it only showed him
what blood type it was and who it was from. Just like the time at the
assembly hall. But if the person was in front of him, it would reveal
their ability, HP and Blood type. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some of the blood
marks in the hall only reviled question marks. Assuming that Quinn
either had to have run into the person before or used the inspect
skill on the person once before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
test tube and gulped. He then pulled out the cork at the top and
start sniffing the blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You're not
going to drink it right here are you?&quot; Layla asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why not, I
need to know if it will make any changes.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't know
it feels kind of embarrassing, I can't explain.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn ignored Layla
and looked at the blood again. The fragrance smelt quite sweet which
was different from how he remembered it before. Then suddenly, Quinn
lifted the tube and drank the blood in one gulp as if he was taking
an alcoholic shot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the blood ran
down his throat, he felt a warm tingling sensation through his body.
The blood was also surprisingly sweet rather than metallic. It seemed
like the race change had also changed his taste buds and sense of
smell. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Your HP is

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; The blood will
have no effect &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Blood from this

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; No stat points
will be given &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was surprised
to see at the information he had been given. The blood last time
seemed to have a healing effect on his body. Judging by the message,
if Quinn was injured Layla's blood would allow him to regain HP. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But the second
message is what interested him more. The system stated because he had
already consumed this blood before, that no stats would be given.
This meant that as long as it was the blood of someone he hadn't
drunk before, he would be able to get an extra stat point. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quin smiled at the
thought. Of course, this was only a theory of his but Quinn wanted to
test it out straight away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I guess
whatever you wanted to test outworked, judging by your creepy smile
and all,&quot; Layla said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If only there
was someone else's blood I could test this on.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then the sound
of two people entering the woods from the playground was heard. Quinn
and Layla immediately ducked down and hid behind a tree. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when they saw
two students started to walk into the forest. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now hand over

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn immediately
recognised the voice. It was Rylee. It looked like he still hadn't
learnt his lesson and was still up to his old tricks. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then went into
his bag and took out the mask he had bought at the convenience store.
Last time he had let Rylee go without taking any of his blood and now
he felt like it was such a waste. But this time Quinn wouldn't let
Rylee go. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn put on his
mask, he moved in closer to where Rylee and the student was. Making
sure to move in and out between the trees. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
want a beating, pass over the credits now!&quot; Rylee said holding
up the student against the tree. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But I only get
ten credits a day, their mine, this isn't fair.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Since when has
this world ever been fair. Blame the people at the top for not
looking out for us.&quot; Rylee said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn herd those
words, he realized that Rylee was in the same position as him. He was
only a level two user and was just part of the weak bunch being
pushed around by those above but that didn't mean he could do it to
others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla followed Quinn
closely and had taken out her bow and arrow. She knew from last time
if Quinn had put on the mask, he was going to act. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you want me
to help out, it will be easier with the two of us,&quot; Layla asked.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's okay
there's something I wanted to test out,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The last time the
two of them had fought, Quinn was only a level 1. Now he was a level
2 and he had also obtained a new skill which he wanted to test and
Rylee was a great test subject. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
move closer and closer. He was hoping to finish of Rylee in one shot
and this was the perfect chance while his back was turned. Finally,
Quinn was just about in striking distance that's when the student
held up against the tree spotted Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please help
me!&quot; The student cried. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You idiot!&quot;
Quinn shouted as he leapt forward hoping he could be quick enough to
hit Rylee before he could activate his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The students warning
had given Rylee enough time to activate his ability and turn around.
However, Quinn's fist was fast and even though Rylee put out his
hands to stop the attack, Quinn's fist still manged to hit Rylee in
the stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The impact was just
like last time, it was solid and felt like he was punching a wall but
the blow managed to still hurt Rylee a bit. The attack was slighter
stronger and this time Quinn's fist hadn't broken. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You, I've been
waiting for you,&quot; Rylee said as he put two fingers in his mouth
and whistled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then two
students came running in from the park and into the forest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You think you
can take on three of us?&quot; Rylee said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
two students running towards them and that's when an arrow came
flying from the words and hit one of them in the knee causing the
student to instantly fall to the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The other students
went down to his friend. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What
happened?&quot; the students said. Then he noticed an arrow in the
student's leg. &quot;Where did this come from?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn saw this as an
opportunity and dashed away from Rylee and started heading towards
the other student. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The skill said
five meters right, well show me what you got!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Quinn was
within five meters, he activated his skill blood swipe at the same
time swinging his hand across. A red line of power came surging out
of Quinn's fingertips and hit the student right on his chest causing
a claw-like mark but it wasn't enough to knock him out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Blood swipe,
Blood swipe, Blood swipe.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then cast
three more blood swipes swinging his arm out. Each blow managed to
hit the student dead on, with multiple marks across his chest, he had
finally collapsed to the floor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; An opponent has
been defeated, 50 exp granted &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Blood swipe had no
cooldown but did use one point of HP per swipe. As long as Quinn had
HP he could continuously cast out his blood swipe skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Rylee seeing his two
teammates who were of equal power level to himself be defeated in an
instant, started to feel scared. His body was shaking and all he
wanted to do was get out of there. He turned away from his friends
and started running deeper into the forest. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's speed was
greater though and was easily able to catch up. When his attack was
in range, Quinn cast two more blood swipes aiming for the back of
Rylee's ankles. As they hit, Rylee fell to the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please, please
don't hurt me I'll do anything!&quot; Rylee begged. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh really,&quot;
Quinn then placed his watch up against Rylee's &quot;hand over all
your credits.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;but if I do, I
won't have enough credits for Dan, he'll kill me,&quot; Rylee said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is now really
the time to worry about Dan?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Rylee quickly
transferred over 50 credits that he had obtained that day over to
Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So will you
let me go now?&quot; Rylee asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, Rylee
could see a sinister smile appear on Quinn's face through the bottom
of his mask. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No!&quot;
Quinn said, he then went up behind Rylee and held him in a chocking
position. Rylee tried activating his hardening skill but Quinn's
strength was still strong enough to get through and eventually caused
Rylee to pass out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's for
pushing me around in the canteen.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then looked at
Rylee's body and noticed that his ankles were bleeding from where he
had used the blood swipe skill. Quinn then went to his bag to pull
out a test tube and held Rylee's leg up allowing the blood to slowly
drip into the test tube, until it filled up. Quinn also filled up a
second tube for testing later on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next were the other
two students. Layla had dealt with the other when she hit with her
arrow earlier and the other student had passed out from the multiple
attacks of blood swipe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then did the
same for with the other two students collecting blood from their open
wounds and from where Layla's arrow had managed to pierce the
student's leg. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After they had
finished collecting the blood, it was time for them to get out of
there and leave the scene. It was getting late and it was almost
curfew time. If the students were out past ten then the guards would
go out looking for you. It seemed like not only did the watches act
as a credit device and power level indicator but it was a tracker as
well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Students who were
found injured outside the school would be taken to the doctor's
office. When the two of them arrived at school it was still 9
o'clock, so they had an hour before they needed to head to their dorm
rooms. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when the two
of them had decided to head to the school roof instead. It was quiet
up there, and no one was around so the two of them could talk freely.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So what do you
need all the blood for?&quot; Layla asked, &quot;you know if you need
some blood you can just take some of mine anytime, I really don't
mind.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thanks, but I
just wanted to test something out.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Inspect,&quot;
Quinn had used his inspect skill on each of the containers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first was
Rylee's blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Here goes,&quot;
Quinn said as he popped the cork open and drank the small tube of
blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn couldn't stop
smiling as he saw the message. He then went on to drink the second
tube of blood. Drinking the blood no longer bothered him once he
found out the taste was quite sweet. All Quinn needed to do was
convince himself it was some type of juice. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; You have

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn thought,
the blood still regained his health, similar to how a potion worked
in a game but once a person's blood had been consumed, it would no
longer give him any stat points. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then drank the
two other test tubes from the other students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at
messages he received and started to notice a pattern. When he drank
Layla's blood which was A+ he had gained a strength point, it was the
same when he drank the A - blood. Rylee whose blood type was B+ had
given him an agility point and lastly, AB + had given him a stamina
point. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Assuming being
positive or negative blood type didn't matter so far. A type had
given him strength, B gave him Agility and AB stamina. That left one
blood group that Quinn hadn't drunk from yet which was O. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After absorbing all
the blood tubes apart from the spare one that contained Layla's
blood, Quinn was feeling stronger than ever. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn's body
before was that of a top athlete in the past, then Quinn now
surpassed the capabilities of regular human power. But he was still
weak compared to those with an ability. Lucky for Quinn, it seemed
like Rylee and the other two students weren't very good fighters. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In Quinn's old
school, he would get into fights all the time regardless of what
ability they had. He saw how the others got bullied more than him,
while the bullying for him lessened because they knew he was a target
that would bite back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But because of this,
Quinn managed to get a good grasp on how people fought and a good
grasp on different abilities. If Quinn was to face a level two user
who was good with their ability like Layla, at this point it was
still most likely he would lose. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>What Quinn needed
more than ever was more skills he could use. Blood swipe was great
but it only had a distance of five meters and it took away his
health. With other abilities, you would be able to obtain new skills
by purchasing books or being taught by someone who already knew the
skill. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't have
this option as there was no one who he knew that had the same ability
as him and that, of course, meant there were no skill books either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before Layla and
Quinn split ways to head back to their dorm rooms, Quinn had one last
request. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you know
about what happened to Vorden?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh your blonde
friend,&quot; Layla replied, &quot;Honestly I don't know too much
cause when everything happened I was stuck in the hospital bed
because of someone.&quot; Layla pointed at Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well, do you
mind finding out for me, it seems like the second years are behind
this and are stopping me and Peter from getting any information.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The second
years are involved in this? Well, that's not good you're not planning
to get involved, are you?&quot; Layla asked concerned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn thought back
to when the second years had called Quinn, Peter and Vorden out. That
Momo person had warned them not to disturb the system within the
school. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wanted to
punch his face in but at the time he couldn't. But now with this
ability, he could grow stronger, without the need of help or relying
on others and he couldn't wait for the day he could punch that Momo's
smug face in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah but I
need to get stronger of course&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was one big
difference between the second years and first years and that was
something called awakening. The second years had learnt how to awaken
their ability. This allowed the user regardless of the power level to
get a power boost for a short period of time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once a user had
awakened, they then also could form something called their soul
weapon. A powerful weapon unique to each user that was formed in the
body itself. This was different from a beast weapon as a beast weapon
could be used by anyone. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After finishing
everything he needed to do with Layla, the two of them split up and
Quinn said he would contact Layla via his watch when he needed her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn also kept the
test tube containing Layla's blood on him. What he needed to do now
was figure out how long his body could go without needing blood. If
Quinn was to go out on a mission or through a portal to another
planet. There might be times where Quinn wouldn't be able to contact
someone for a while. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In these situations,
he needed to know how many Test tubes of blood to take with him. So,
for now, Quinn would do his best to avoid blood until the system
message appeared again. If he fought anyone along the way he could
keep their blood for after. He didn't want to waste any precious stat
points after all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn headed back to
his dorm room where Vorden and Peter where still practising their
Earth abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I did it, I
finally did it!&quot; Peter shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter held a small
round solid lump of mud in his hand. As he moved his hands, he was
able to change the shape of the mud. He turned it from a ball into a
long staff. Then back into a ball again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The only
problem is as a level one user, you will need to keep some type of
mud on you at all times,&quot; Vorden explained. &quot;Perhaps it's
best you keep it as a round staff and carry it around with you, then
you will always have something to take with you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then grabbed
the mud and started to demonstrate, He did the same thing as Peter
and started to change the Mudball into different shapes. But the
difference between speeds was noticeable. While Peter took a long
time to form the shape he wanted. Vorden was changing the mud in
seconds. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wow is this
cause you're a level five user Vorden?&quot; Peter asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No this is
something you should be able to do as well, it just takes practise.
When I copy someone's ability, I also copy whatever power level it is
at. So everything I can do with this mud you should be able to as
well.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then turned
the Mudball into a sharp dagger and placed it up against Peter's
neck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;See, not so
useless after all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Peter gulped as he
looked down at the sword but then realised that Vorden had already
changed the balls shape into a harmless stick and handed it back to
Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, Quinn your

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, a little

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Vorden here
said you got a girlfriend.&quot; Peter quickly added. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh her, no
we're just…&quot; Quinn started to think about what his
relationship with Layla was. He wouldn't exactly call them friends
and they defiantly weren't lovers. Layla did almost everything Quinn
asked without answers. It was almost a master and servant
relationship but If Quinn said that they would defiantly get the
wrong idea. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

Quinn right now could barely deal with the level 2 first-year

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as Quinn
realised that his inspect skill would tell him the stats of each
weapon, he started to go around the room looking for the perfect one
for him. Quinn ruled out anything that was too heavy. Although the
strength stat it added was good, Quinn needed to be fast and agile in
the night. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All the weapons
Quinn had inspected so far was at the basic tier level. The lowest
level a weapon could be. Weapons were categorised into eight
different levels depending on which beast core it was made with. Of
course, this was based on beasts from planets that had already been
discovered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was sure to be
other planets with stronger beasts and abilities that they had yet to
find out about, that may be categorised above that. In the human
world today, there were two known weapons of this class. The world
called them Demon weapons instead. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After searching
around the room for a while, Quinn came across a weapon that stood
out from the rest. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; This weapon is
compatible with the skill &quot;Blood swipe&quot;. When used with the
gauntlets blood swipe will have an increase of 5% in power.&gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Gauntlets were
black in colour and had little tiny horns going up the forearm. The
fingertips where were pointed and bladed at the ends, it made them
look almost like some type of Dragon claw. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were two
reasons why the weapon had interested Quinn. The first was it was the
only one that had also given him a defensive stat, not just a
strength stat but the second one stood out to him even more. It was
the fact that it increases the power of his only skill, blood swipe. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Five percent didn't
sound like a lot right now but if in the future Quinn was to get more
powerful, five percent would make a huge difference. There were also
other bonuses. The gauntlets acted as armour for his hands and he
could still hold other weapons if he needed to. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What a strange

teacher. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's not many
peoples first choice. With a weapon like this, you have to have no
fear and get in close to your enemy. But that is also the reason it
is sturdy than most and can be used as a form of defence.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had already
experienced fighting more than most kids, he was used to using his
fists, with his blood swipe skill as well, he didn't always have to
get up right close to his opponent. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you mind if

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Go ahead,&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now when Quinn
checked out his status screen, he had a smaller number next to his
stats which would indicate the equipment level. Quinn now had 15 stat
points in strength. He felt three times stronger compared to before
he had discovered the system and was ready to test out his newfound
strength. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once everyone had

around the centre ring. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now I won't
claim to be an expert in every weapon,&quot; Said Leo, &quot;Some of
you might even be able to use your weapons better than me. But what I
am an expert in is fighting with weapons alone. Fighting can be
considered a game. You are always trying to predict your opponent's
next move, you measure your opponent's ability and so on. For your
first lesson, I want to see what you've got. We will have a sparring
match. Two people at a time. We will all watch the match and
commentate on what could be improved on. Now, are there any
volunteers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In an instant, Erin
was the first to put her hand up. Without even waiting for Leo to say
anything she headed for the arena in the middle and stood inside. She
held a single silver longsword that shined bright. It wasn't one of
the weapons that Quinn had seen on the wall so he could only assume
it had been one she already owned. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, a lot of
the students were hesitant of going up against Erin. Her reputation
for being a high-power level had already reached many peoples ears. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I also
forgot to add, Abilities will be banned during today's sparing
sessions,&quot; Leo added. &quot;It is important that you know how to
use your weapon first, only then can you truly bring out the full
potential of the weapon with your ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After saying those

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, A large

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man charged in
wielding his large axe above his head. When he swung it down Erin
spun her body to the side avoiding the blow and at the same time
slashed at the back of the man's legs causing him to stumble. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everything had
happened in an instant and the room was suddenly silenced. They all
knew Erin was strong but it was unexpected of her to be so skilful
with the blade. Most ability users, if they had a strong ability like
Erin, would rely on that power and not bother learning a weapon. But
it was clear to everyone she had some practice. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the fight had

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The group continued
to watch a few fights, the rest of the fights had lasted a lot longer
than Erin's, as most of the students were equally matched when it

down to skill and the body. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next fight that
had caught Leo's attention, was the fight with Layla. Even though
Layla could no longer use her telekinesis. With her bow, she was able
to shot ahead and predict where her opponent would turn. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn walked up
to the stage he noticed that Brandon, his opponent's indicator showed
that he was at the power level of three. If this was a fight in the
outside world, where they both could use their abilities Quinn felt
like he didn't have much chance of winning. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But here in the
arena, where abilities weren't allowed. Quinn had a body stronger

a Vampires strength was far greater than the human race before the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Brandon immediately
charged in with his spear, while Quinn stood there and took a
fighting stance with both of his hands held out in front of him. When
Brandon was within striking distance, he thrust his spear forward. It
was fast and impressive to the people watching outside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But to Quinn who had
12 points in agility, it was easy for him to dodge. He avoided the
spear strike and ducked down, then before Brandon could pull the
spear back Quinn went and grabbed the spear with his hand. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While holding the
spear with one hand, Quinn opened up his other hand and swung out his
fist like a claw as hard as he could at the spear. Then a few moments
later the spear had been sliced in half. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the, my

step in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn rushed forward
and before Brandon could do anything, Quinn punched him hard in the
stomach. Brandon's feet lifted off the ground and it looked like his
body was about to fly away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn knew that if
Brandon was to fly out of the arena it would be considered his win
but the system wouldn't allow him to win like that, he needed to beat
his opponent down to at least one HP. So before Brandon could be
lifted into the air, Quinn grabbed him and pulled him back down and
at the same time kneed him in the face causing Brandon's nose to
bleed and his head to be sent backwords. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After defeating
Brandon, Quinn had received multiple messages and had even levelled
up. The bonus reward for defeating a level 3 user was higher than
when he defeated a level 2 user. However, it was a shame that the
bonus reward was only a one-time thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the messages,
there was also a new skill that had been unlocked. Although Quinn
didn't have the time to look at it now, he needed to get off the
stage and look at it later. Before leaving Quinn looked at Brandon
who was lying on the floor. Blood was dripping from his nose and
Quinn just had one thought. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a shame Quinn

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two military men
again appeared out of thin air and took Brandon away to the doctor's

shouted from the crowd. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These two were

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo then stepped up
onto the stage and picked up the broken spear of from the ground and
started to inspect it. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Then how can
you explain the weapon breaking. &quot;Fei said, &quot;Unless, it has
to be it, he cheated and used an ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as
acquisitions were made, the crowd started mumbling to each other.
They could see Quinn's power level but not many knew about Quinn
having no ability. Perhaps he had an ability that simply enhanced his
strength the students thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Settle down

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then an unexpected
person had chimed in and interrupted their conversation. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You fool, will
you stop being so disrespectful to the teacher.&quot; Erin said, &quot;Do
you not know who he Is, Perhaps if I told you his war name you would
know. This man is General Leo, or known as the Blind swordsman.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The chatting between
the students had gotten even louder. The name Blind swordsman was
known well between common folk. He had helped out a great deal when
fighting against the Dalki. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's blind?&quot;
Loop said unsure whether it was true or not. &quot;Doesn't that mean
he definitely couldn't tell if the person used an ability or not.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In that instant, Leo
threw a piece of the broken spear in the direction of Loop. The spear
just missed Loop and had hit the back wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Loop then started to
feel a sharp stinging pain on his cheek, as he touched his cheek he
noticed a scratch mark. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I can see, and
hear very well. Better than most of you. My ability allows me to see
the Aura of people and when people start to use their ability, their
aura's change depending on what ability they are using. And I'm
telling you now, Quinn didn't use a single ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the
students startled to settle down a bit. It was a memorable first day
for all the students in the weapon club so much had happened. But the
class was finally over and it was time for them to head home. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leo, however,
couldn't stop thinking about the student known as Quinn. He inspected
the spear again and again and found nothing out of the ordinary.
However, what Leo didn't reveal was form the very beginning when
Quinn had stepped into the room, he could see his aura was slightly
different from everyone else's. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It wasn't the same
as when someone used an ability though, it reminded him of an aura of
that of the beasts or the Dalki had, one that wasn't human. </FONT></FONT>

was no evolution process this time, he still gained five points of HP

was the fact that his stat points were halved in sunlight. </FONT></FONT>

stick with his plan and add the stat point to agility, as long as he
could hit his opponents without being hit back, he couldn't see
himself losing and worst case if he couldn't hurt his opponent, he
could always run away. It was also handy if he planned to use the
clawed gauntlets as his choice of weapon. He would need to be fast to
get in close and use hand to hand combat skills. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The attack from
Leo's katana blade came from underneath, Quinn held out both his
hands to block the attack but suddenly it looked like the blade had
disappeared and phased through his hands. Before Quinn knew it, the
blade was right underneath his chin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, looks like
our time is up.&quot; Leo said, &quot;About level 14 or 13 maybe,
that's pretty good for a first-year student.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was in
admiration for the weapons teacher. At first, he didn't have a lot of
respect for the teachers at the school. They would usually just
dominate over the students and tell them to toughen up and get
stronger but Quinn felt like Leo was different. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn could now tell
that Leo was able to beat him in a fight anytime he wanted, Leo was
just testing him to see how strong he was. What Quinn also learnt
during that fight was just getting stronger and faster wasn't good
enough, he needed to learn how to fight properly. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please, would
you be able to teach me how to fight?&quot; Quinn asked as he bowed
down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Unfortunately,
the weapon you have chosen I do not specialise in myself. Although I
do think it suits your fighting style, it seems like you have had
some experience in hand to hand combat.&quot; Leo explained. &quot;There
is one thing I can suggest to you, there's a popular VR fighting game
that the military students from all the other schools play, the first
thing you will need to do is get experience. Although the use of
abilities in the game is not prohibited, so you might have a hard
time but still, I think it will be a good experience for you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you so
much,&quot; Quinn said as he bowed down again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, and before
I forget, its been awhile since I have had fun like that, as a prize
feel free to keep the gauntlets. When you get better in the future
come and challenge me anytime, I will be happy to fight you again.&quot;
Leo said as he walked off back to the centre of the weapons hall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After watching the
fight, many of the students were quite disappointed. After seeing
Quinn fight well against Brandon, they were hoping he would be able
to do something against Leo but to them, all it looked like was Leo
toying with Quinn and throwing him around like a rag doll. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Brandon then had
come up with a brilliant idea and started to whisper into his
friend's Fei's ear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright
students, it is time to get into your next paring,&quot; Leo shouted.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then before
Layla could get up and ask Quinn for a match, Brandon had gotten up
in front of her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you mind if
us two have a round?&quot; Brandon asked </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla kissed at her
teeth and scorned but she didn't exactly have a good reason to say
no. After all, it would only be a minute. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then another
student, Brandon's friend Fei had gone and approached Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please I would
like to be your next opponent,&quot; Fei asked as he drew out his two
short swords. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I don't see
why not,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn didn't mind
too much. So far, every new opponent he faced as long as he defeated
them, would grant him 50 Exp and this was the best chance he had
right now, in the weapons hall where people weren't allowed to use
their abilities. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And Please,
Begin!&quot; Leo shouted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fei seemed to have
some experience using the duel swords. His flow was natural and he
was able to follow his attacks up well from one to the next but after
fighting with Leo, the attacks just seemed slow. Quinn was able to
see the path of each strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But just like Leo
had said the most important thing for Quinn was the experience, so
rather than relying on his supernatural strength and end the fight in
an instant. Quinn decided he wanted to fight a little longer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, in Layla
and Brandon's match, Brandon didn't seem to be doing much at all. He
didn't charge in and he didn't attack, all he did was avoid Layla's
arrows. It was as if his mind was focused on something else. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when a noise
was heard. Fei was charging in at Quinn and did some sought of little
battle cry. That was the signal for Brandon to act. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Brandon then lifted
his hand and at the right time, cast his wind blast right behind at
Quinn's back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn saw Fei's
blades and was ready to block but that's when he felt a strong force
push him from behind. It knocked him off balance and at the same
time, Fei's blades went right into Quinn's stomach. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a brief moment,
Quinn had forgotten about a world with abilities. A world where
people didn't try to get up on one another, just for the sake of
what? Pride. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He looked down and
could see the two blades stuck in his stomach, blood dripping off the
blade. Fei had let go of the blades and took a step back, with his
mouth wide open, acting like everything that had happened was an
accident. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn wasn't
buying it and he had a good idea what had just happened. As he looked
around, he managed to catch a smile on Brandon's face. Quinn then
grabbed the hilt half of the two blades and using his strength
snapped the ends off. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With the other half
of the blades still in his stomach, he started to walk towards Fei. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So you want to
play games then.&quot; Quinn said, &quot;Then let's play some games,
you've taken some of my blood, so it's only right that I take some of
yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Fei heard these
words, he couldn't help but move back away from Quinn. Something was
different, the look in his eyes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why is my body
shaking, he's only a level one user, calm down.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when Quinn was
only a few feet away, he swung his clawed hand out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But before Quinn
could finish casting his skill, his hand was knocked away by a blade.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Enough, stop
now,&quot; Leo said as he pointed his blade towards Quinn. &quot;Two
wrongs do not make a right.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And you two
don't think your plan didn't go unnoticed. I will not have students
who can't follow the rules in my class. You can leave your weapons
here and you are banned from any more combat classes in the weapon

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then, two
military men had appeared out of nowhere standing by Quinn's side. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Take him to
the doctor's office and make sure he gets treated,&quot; Leo said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait!&quot;
Layla shouted. &quot;Maybe I should go with him, make sure he is
okay?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;He's a strong
boy, worry not young lady he can take care of himself.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Layla was
worried about Quinn being hurt, that wasn't her main concern. It
looked like from the wounds on Quinn's body that he had lost a lot of
blood. Even if vampires could heal at supernatural speeds that energy
had to come from somewhere and would soon need to be replaced. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After grabbing Quinn
by both of his arms, after a few seconds, Quinn was transported just
outside the doctor's office. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Please get
some rest once you have healed up.&quot; One of the men said before
teleporting away once again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What a handy
ability to have.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After checking the
men had disappeared, Quinn decided to head to the closest bathroom on
the same floor. Nearly all the students were in combat classes at the
moment so the halls were empty. The reason why Quinn had decided to
head to the bathroom rather than to the doctor's office was because
he could already feel his body was healing up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His status screen
also confirmed that fact. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just like before as
soon as Quinn was out of combat, his body was starting to heal at an
incredibly fast rate. Quinn looked down and it looked like his body
had healed most of the wounds. However, it wasn't able to heal the
area where the blades were stuck. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Luckily Quinn still
had his gauntlets on so he didn't have to grab the blades with his
bare hands. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;1, 2 ,3&quot;
He then pulled the blades out as fast he could in one action. The
pain was quick and sharp and he did everything he could to hold in
his screams. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the wounds
around his stomach were slowly starting to heal until suddenly he
received some new messages. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; You will no
longer heal &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt; Your HP will
continue to decrease by – 1 HP until human blood has been consumed
&gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn looked at the
message and was trying to figure out what had happened. When Quinn
did his tests he found out that his body would need to consume blood
once every two days. But this message had come up even though Quinn
had only consumed Layla's blood this morning, it hadn't reached the
time limit yet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Quinn thought
back to how the blood was able to heal his health. If it worked the
same way then that meant his body was using blood as energy to heal
himself. Once this energy had run out inside his body then he would
no longer be able to heal and he would once again have to consume
blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn felt a hunger
in his stomach and started to look at himself in the mirror, his
clothes were all bloody and he was in slight pain, but he still
cracked a smile. That's when Quinn also noticed that his top two
teeth had grown slightly. It was different to last time when he had
panicked this time, he felt calm. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He was used to
taking blood and he already knew who his next targets were going to
be tonight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The hunger pangs
were bearable this time, perhaps because Quinn wasn't in a critical
condition. After heading back to his dorm room Quinn threw his bloody
clothes on the floor and changed his clothes out with a different
uniform. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While Quinn was busy
getting changed, he heard the sound of two students talking as they
walked down the corridor. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why did I get

Fei complained. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, you were

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when Fei

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then took the
mask out from his bag and put it on his face. Before he moved onto
the rooftop, he used a rag of ripped cloth from his old uniform and
wrapped it around his watch to hide his power level. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There weren't many

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the…&quot;
Fei was to slow to react and all he could do was lift his hand but
the blow was extremely powerful, when the red lines touched his skin
it immediately caused blood to be drawn. It felt like five sharp

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only that, but
the force was so strong it managed to throw Fei into the air. With
his 12 strength and extra 3 from the gauntlets, Quinn now had a total
of 15 strength, and then the gauntlets also increased his attack
power by 5% making the attack far stronger than Quinn had predicted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That was because of

stronger than that of a basic tier beast weapon. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a strong
attack and it had hurt Quinn badly. Loop retracted the bone spikes
into his body and was ready for the same attack again. As he breathed
in though, he could see Quinn swipe his hand like a claw. Loop ducked
down and instead of hitting him, the attack continued to go past and
the red lines eventually disappeared into nothing. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn looked at
Loop's body on the ground, he noticed something strange. His current
health was at 10 Hp and his body was naturally drawn to the blood.
Whenever his health was low, he would get hungrier, that bit was a
given but something that also happened was his two canine teeth would
start to grow longer. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When they grow
longer it made it easier to pierce his victim's neck. Although Loop
was bleeding and Quinn was able to just drink from the open wound.
This would only give him the extra stat point. He needed a good
supply to also fill his blood bank. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn debated
internally for a few minutes whether he should put his stat point
into stamina or not. If he did his stats would become well rounded.
But he thought about all the people who were strong in the world
right now. They were usually a specialist in a certain area. A jack
of all trades was something too weak in this day and age. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not only that but
Quinn felt like his growth would be quicker if he specialized in
strength or Agility. It would allow him to carry on beating weak
opponents. Then when he needed to, he could increase his stamina
points at another time. It wasn't like Quinn was going to be facing
an army of opponents any time soon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, Quinn
decided to stick to his original plan and add his stat points into

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn stood in place
looking at the duos body's wondering what he should do. He was fairly
certain that he had acted fast enough during his fight with Fei. He
hoped that he hadn't seen anything that could give him away, but he
couldn't say the same for Loop. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn started
to inspect Fei's body, he noticed that the bite marks on Fei's neck
from Quinn had already disappeared. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The doctor
said the same thing happened with Layla, perhaps some type of effect
from my ability?&quot; Quinn thought, &quot;Well, that solves that
problem, now what to do with you?&quot; Quinn pondered looking at
Loop's body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn wore
his mask there was still the chance of someone figuring out it was
him. After all, how many students used gauntlets as a weapon and also
would have a grudge to attack these two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, Quinn
wasn't that afraid of them finding out his real identity, after all
the school didn't really care if Quinn beat them half to death.
Actions like this were commonplace at the academy. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wasn't afraid
that Loop might tell everyone what he had seen. Even if he did, no
one would believe what he had said. Throughout all of the history of
abilities, there had never been any reports of an ability where
someone had to consume something to gain power. The power had always
come from within. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And with no markings

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There you

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had taken too
much time, he wasn't planning to take out two people. When a student
was knocked out in the school or badly beaten the wristwatch was able
to ping their location to the school and inform them, they were hurt.

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then once this

and take them to the hospital. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No one knew how it
quite worked as it was amazing, the watch was able to tell how much
health someone had. Rumours were spread that it was an ability of an
original that created the watches. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn and Layla
hastily ran down the stairs but stopped as they could hear the sound
of footsteps coming in their direction. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh no! We
can't go this way.&quot; Layla then started to look around the roof.
&quot;I have a plan, grab me and let's jump.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are you
crazy!&quot; Quinn said, &quot;Even with my strength from this
height, I would at least break my legs and even if I can heal, I
still feel pain!&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn quickly lifted
Layla with both arms despite his protest. With his strength, Layla
was lighter than ever. He jumped onto the fence and looked down. The
school was incredibly high, it was at least four stories. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the duo was
falling from the rooftop at an incredible speed, Layla closed he eyes
and started to concentrate. Sweat started to form on her brows when
suddenly, the two of them started to decrease in speed. They

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No, my ability

slow us down. Come on let's head back to our rooms.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Not really, he
has nothing to gain from it, without any proof no one would believe
him anyway, but there is one problem. There is the chance that if he
does find out it's me, then he would come back with the others and
attack me. I could take them out one on one, but as a group, I don't
feel like I could stand a chance.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's true.&quot;
Layla replied, &quot;A lot of the students have already formed their
own groups and gangs to protect each other, all that's left are the
ones that are too weak to be a part of anything. I know, why don't
you create your own group? I could be like a sub-leader. Of course,
we would keep your thing a secret.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;That's not a
bad idea, especially if in the future we get targeted even more,
maybe I should ask Vorden if he knows anyone.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The look on Layla's

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Quinn had
arrived back in his dorm room, he was surprised to see that neither
Vorden or Peter seemed to be there. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's nearly
curfew time, I wonder what they're doing out so late?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a shame
because Quinn was hoping to either ask Peter or Vorden what exactly
happened between them and Layla but with it getting late and Quinn
low on energy, he decided to get some sleep ahead of the others. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And as soon as his
body had hit the bed, he was out in an instant, he didn't even change
his clothes and he just laid there on top of it like an old drunk
man. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A few moments later
and Peter was the first to arrive back in the dorm room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He slowly entered
the room and didn't even acknowledge the fact that Quinn had
returned. He walked slowly over to his bed and placed the quilt over
his head, slightly shaking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then soon after
Vorden had arrived. He could see a bulge wrapped underneath the
sheets on peter's bed, then Vorden noticed that Quinn was sleeping. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden looked at
Quinn's peaceful face he smiled. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like you
were fine,&quot; Vorden whispered to himself. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each one of them was
dealing with their own problems, yet not one of them knew of the
others. With a lot on their mind and no one to share it with, they
had to sleep with their demons that night. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn woke up he
was greeted with his usual morning message. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&lt;Daily quest
complete: Avoid direct sunlight for eight hours. &gt; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was satisfied
with his growth in strength, however, he couldn't say the same about
his levelling speed. He was currently only level three and had two
skills he could use. Unlike other abilities where they gave you the
control of something, Quinn's skills were a one action type thing. If
Quinn wanted to be on an even playing field with the higher-level
ability users then Quinn would need more skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After fighting with
Loop yesterday Quinn realised he needed a few things. The first was
he needed to get better at fighting. Although his skills had been
fine with defeating low levels so far, he couldn't say the same when
it came to opponents who knew how to fight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was only because
of Quinn's blood bank yesterday that he was able to win the fight and
fight recklessly. This meant he needed to learn some hand to hand
combat skills. The second thing was he couldn't go out fighting
students every day. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Yesterday was a
close call and he still didn't know if Loop knew it was him or not
who attacked. If he wanted to keep this a secret, he would have to
limit his activity at night. Or get strong enough so he didn't have
to rely on the gauntlets which were a dead giveaway. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That left him with a
new goal. When checking out the system Quinn remembered that there
was a shop function that would only open at level 10. This was now
Quinn's new target, he had no idea what the shop would detail but so
far the system hadn't let him down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When Vorden had
woken up he acted like his usual self as he always had done in front
of Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey did you
get a good sleep?&quot; Vorden asked, &quot;When I came in yesterday
you were completely knocked out.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, I was
pretty worn out yesterday after combat classes.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I heard you
got in an accident, is everything okay?&quot; Vorden asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;As you can
see, I have made a complete recovery you don't need to worry about
me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, seriously
though, Quinn if you're getting bullied or hurt just tell me. I know
we said not to help each other out so the second-year students
wouldn't get involved but I can handle them don't worry.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn smiled back at
Vorden. He couldn't understand what Layla was so worried about. The
Vorden in front of him now was the Vorden Quinn grew to like. Sure,
he seemed to have his problems and lash out at times but who didn't? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not wanting to ruin
the nice atmosphere between the two of them, Quinn decided that he
would ask Peter once the two of them were alone what happened.
Besides if he asked Vorden there was the chance he would get a
one-sided view of the events. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Peter woke up
Vorden greeted him too, but Peter only said very few words back. Now
even Peter was acting strangely Quinn thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Is everything
okay Peter?&quot; Quinn asked </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Huh, Yeah I'm
fine,&quot; Peter replied as he got dressed into a new uniform, a
little bit spaced out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The three of them
then started to head to the canteen and as they were walking through
the hallways. Quinn had spotted someone who he didn't want to see
first thing in the morning, it was Loop. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But as the two of
them locked eyes, Loop instantly started to break out into a sweat
and his hands were shaking uncontrollably. When the two walked by
each other, Loop stopped and called out to Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey is it okay
to talk to you, in private?&quot; Loop asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn immediately
started to look around to see if there were any of Loop's friends
nearby. If Loop was calling out to him it was most likely because he
had figured out that Quinn was the one who had attacked him and Fei. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn had put this
into his calculations that they might group up to attack him but he
didn't think something would happen so soon. However, when he looked
around there was no site of Brandon or even Fei nearby. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With multiple
students surrounding them, Quinn felt like it was unlikely that Loop
would try anything here, and even if he did, he could at least defend
himself without reviling his skills. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey is
everything okay?&quot; Vorden said in a stern voice not breaking eye
contact with Loop. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah it's fine
Vorden, you two go ahead I'll catch up with you in a bit.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden and Peter
walked away, Vorden couldn't help himself, he kept staring back at
where Quinn was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them then
walked off to a nearby classroom just down the hallway to the
canteen. It was breakfast time so classes hadn't started yet and the
classrooms were empty. Of course, Quinn made sure to stay by the door
just in case Loop started to attack. That way he could run out into
the hall where the rest of the students were. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Loop stood there
nervous and fidgeting, it seemed like he was struggling to get his
words out, until he finally spoke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I'm sorry
about yesterday,&quot; Loop said as he bowed. &quot;I know we hurt
you in training and you probably coming back at us for revenge but
please forgive me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was
speechless, this was unexpected and he didn't have a clue what was
going on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I Promise I
won't tell anyone about your secret, please whatever you do just let
me live. I won't bother you again and no one will ever know anything
happened.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Quinn had
his suspicions that this was all an act. It seemed like Loop was
genuine, either that or he was the best actor in the world. But what
Quinn didn't understand was what on earth had happened to get Loop to
act like this. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thanks for
keeping my secret, besides I don't really have a grudge against you.
Although your friends were the one to act on me, you didn't do
anything. You were just trying to help your friends.&quot; Quinn
said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Thank you,
thank you for sparing me,&quot; Loop said. &quot;I promise if you
need anything, I will help you, I just don't want what happened to
Brandon happening to me.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Brandon?&quot;

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At first, Loop was
confused by the words that had come out of Quinn's mouth. There were
two possible reasons he could be acting like this. Either Quinn was
just pretending not to know or when Brandon entered the hospital, he
was still alive at the time. Meaning Quinn thought Brandon was still
alive after attacking him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Look I promise
I'll keep your secret, I know you attacked Fei because of what
happened at the weapons hall, it had to be you. Who else would attack
him and have gauntlets like you? So you decided to go after Brandon
next after taking down me.&quot; Fei explained. &quot;Look I just
want to continue living in school as normal, I don't want any drama.
I don't know why you're hiding behind that fake power level of yours
but please, I just don't want to get involved and I'll stay out of
your way.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn was trying his
best to process the information he had just been told. Right now a
student had died. To be honest, he wasn't really sure what the
process or punishment was for a student's death and at the same time,
he didn't want to find out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If the other
students were to learn about the attacks on Fei and Brandon, they
would naturally assume it might have been Quinn wanting payback.
However, the one thing that would make them doubt that, was the fact
that he was only a level 1 student. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right now, only Loop

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You don't have

stay at of yours.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After Loop had left
there was a thought lingering on Quinn's mind. Just who did kill
Brandon? Was their anyone in the school that had a grudge against
him? They had only been at the school a few days and the school
purposely made sure no one knew each other before sending them here. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was hard for
Quinn to come up with a suspect, all he knew about Brandon was what
had happened at the combat classes. If a petty person like him was
able to plan an attack like that, then perhaps he had made many

&quot;I don't know if you know this but Peter is only a level one,

It was clear to her that Vorden was unstable. It was as if his mood

Layla wasn't buying it. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn diligently
watched the blonde man in the video, he noticed several things that
he read about in fantasy novels that all pointed to the tall man
being a vampire. The ghastly pale skin, the beautiful looks and
finally, the red eyes. Not only that but the man in the video also
stated that Quinn was one of them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If Quinn was trying
to understand the meaning behind his words, the man was stating that
he was a Vampire. Although there was also some other strange wording
the man had said as well. The fact that he didn't know how much time
had passed. Did it mean the video was made a long time ago, was the
man in the video even still alive? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For now, Quinn had
to put all of the questions he had to the side, as there was nothing
he could do to confirm it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video continued
to play, and the tall blonde man started to speak again. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;To whomever,
this video happens to be shown to, I will now demonstrate a set of
skills that you should be able to perform at your level. Our kind and
or abilities work best when we use a weapon that covers our hands.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man then
proceeded to get into a fighting stance. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I will cover
two sets of basic moves and it's up to you to learn them and figure
out how to use them in fights. If you forget, feel free to open up
your system at any time and watch the videos again.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The first move
is a defensive move; I call it Flash step. To perform this, if the
system has been set up correctly, you will need at least 15 points of
agility.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The man then
proceeded to perform the flash step. He crouched down and moved to
another corner of the room in an instant, at the same time an
afterimage of him was being shown. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now this skill
uses up a lot of stamina so even if you have enough Agility points to
perform this skill, be careful not to wear yourself out. I would only
use it when avoiding a fatal blow or going in for an attack. Please
also make note that although the move is fast and hard to be seen by
the naked eye, at most it can only move you at the distance of five
meters.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Looking at the move,
Quinn straight away realised how handy it would be to have something
like this. In his last fight against Loop, he could have avoided
several blows at the last second. The only thing was it was a shame
that Quinn currently didn't have enough Agility points to practise
the move. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The next skill
I will show you is the Hammer strike.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again, the man
got in a fighting stance, this time he lifted his right foot and
slammed it onto the ground while at the same time he pulled back his
left hand and threw out his right hand. All of this was done in one
smooth motion. Just from watching the video, Quinn could see that the
air had slightly moved.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Cool right,&quot;
the man said smiling. &quot;For this skill, you will need at least 15
strength as well. That is all for today, when you are ready, the next
set of hand to hand combat classes will be unlocked for you. If you
want a slowed down and more detailed version of these videos, they
will be saved in your system. Good luck my friend and I wish you all
the best.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the man had
finished talking the video immediately ended. As Quinn opened up his
system there was now an extra Tab that stated tutorial and in it,
were two videos of the skills he had just been shown. When watching
the videos, it was just as the man had said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The video contained
slowed down versions of the skills the man had recently performed,
there was even detailed commentary on how the skills would work and
what you needed to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn couldn't help
but think who this guy was. The way he spoke clearly meant he knew
about the system. Did that mean he was the creator of the Book
Quinn's parents had left him? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But it was hard for
Quinn to remember meeting anyone like the man in the video. He didn't
even know what his parents faces looked like that well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Whatever it was, he
was happy that the system was starting to help him out more. He felt
like the system at first had given him a hard time giving him Quests
to drink blood and drawbacks such as halving his stats while in the
sun. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But now Quinn was
starting to feel happy that he had discovered the system more than
ever. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn immediately
started to watch the Hammer strike video. As long as he wore the
gauntlets, he technically had more than 15 strength. He wasn't sure
if that counted but there was no harm in trying. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

watching the video, Leo had come up and approached him. </FONT></FONT>

noticed two military men were standing behind.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

it not strange that Vorden approached you in the first place, He's a

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the two
continued to practise their combat classes. Although Quinn was trying
his best to learn the hammer strike move, he couldn't concentrate. He
kept thinking about the words that Layla had said. Right now there
were no suspects to Brandon's death and Vorden had acted oddly a view
times. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, the
first-year students had gathered in the assembly hall as asked. There
was chatter amongst themselves as there seemed to be no sign of any
teachers and only the second-year students. It was easy to tell the
difference between years with students, as there was a rank embed on
their shirt that told the difference. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;HAve all the
students arrived yet?&quot; Momo Asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes, everyone
from Del's class and the weapon's combat class should be here.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Well it's time
to show everyone what happens when you don't follow the rules&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At that moment Momo
pulled a piece of string pulling back the curtains reviling what was
behind them. As the curtains were drawn, a badly beaten up Vorden was
on display, tied to a large wooden plank. Both of his hands were
slotted into holes while his body was made to stand, and it looked
like his legs were wired down by some type of ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then several of
the second-year students pulled out carts that seemed to be filled
with large black circular stones. Momo picked up one of the round
balls and held it in his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;This here is a
metal ball that had been embedded with the power of a beast crystal.&quot;
Said Momo, &quot;When the earth had found a way to mix the beast
crystal with our own weapons, it was a turning point in the war, but
what they don't teach you as first years, is that beast weapons need
to be activated with your ability. Once activated they can give out
extra power. The higher the beast crystal used to make the weapon,
the higher the power.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn watching the
whole thing couldn't help but look at the badly beaten up Vorden. He
was wondering how on earth Momo could stand there and talk so
casually as if he was giving a presentation to the whole class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So us second
years have decided to give you from the beast weapons class and some
of you other first-year students a shortcut. Today we will show you
how to activate a beast weapon using these balls.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when a
first-year student raised his hand to ask a question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Um excuse me,
but does any of the teachers know about this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a moment there
was silence, even the first years couldn't believe why someone would
ask that in this situation. It was obvious that this was being done
behind the teacher's backs. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then a second-year
student had come from the side of the assembly hall and immediately
punched the student who asked the question in the face. The
second-year student repeatedly punched the person until he eventually
passed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Are there any
more questions?&quot; Momo asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first-year
students stood there silent in fear. They didn't want to say anything
especially after they had seen what happened to the boy who had just
asked a question. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Good.&quot;
Momo said before continuing, &quot;Now to explain, these beast stones
here were made with the purpose to help you activate your equipment
so, to be honest, they're quite useless but they are handy for
demonstrating. Just like when you activate your ability in your body,
you need to concentrate on the ball in front of you. Think of it as a
part of your body and focus your ability on it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The stone ball being
held in Momo's hand suddenly went from a black to a green colour. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now usually
your weapons wouldn't change colour when activated but as I said
earlier these balls are you just for the sake of helping you learn
how to activate your weapons. Once the colour has changed that means
it has been activated and its strength has increased. Now today we
will be practising, target hitting.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second-year
students then moved Vorden down from the stage and onto the floor
with the other first-year students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The board here
is special you see, even a bullet wouldn't be able to penetrate
through it, only the power of a beast weapon can, so today's lesson
is to throw the ball and hit the target. Simple right?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What, is this
really allowed?&quot; A student asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And what do
they mean by the target, the board it's so thin, they're basically
telling us to hit him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Won't we get
into trouble for doing something like this?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What do you
mean, the teachers don't care when we got beat before why would they
care about something like this now. The second years are doing this
only because they know they can get away with it. They have been here
longer than us.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Momo started to look
at the crowd, when his eyes finally had met with Quinn's. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Oh, I almost
forgot, the crazy boy here has been targeting us second years one by
one, thinking we wouldn't notice. Not only did he not head our
warning but he completely ignored it and came after us. We dealt with
him in this very hall back then but he still didn't listen. Now, this
is a warning to you all. This is what happens to those who try to
disrupt the flow in school.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second years
then poured out the crates of black beast stones. They all fell out
and rolled onto the ground floor. There were more than enough stones
there for each student to throw at least one ball at Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Now who wants
to go first.&quot; One of the second students said. &quot;Hurry now
if no one want's to volunteer then I will just have to pick one of
you.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As expected not a
single person had volunteered. The students were cruel to those who
were weaker to them but not like this. Usually, it would be a case of
just better treatment but it seemed like the second years were
targeting Vorden. Whatever Vorden had done, he really had annoyed
them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Alright then,
you the girl with the brown hair, you go first.&quot; The second-year
student said as he put one of the balls in her hand. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Really, well

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Two of the
second-year students went ahead and grabbed the female by her arms
and spread her out. She struggled to break free and was wondering if
she should use her ability. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The girl started to

up for her, but they all looked away trying to avoid eye contact. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Momo picked up one

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The ball flew out of

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The next student was
a male, he had the ability level of 2.5 but when he held the ball it
managed to change in colour more activating the beast core's powers.

himself next, Momo couldn't help but think he was up to something. He
knew the two of them were friends so why would he volunteer? </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In a way, this whole
demonstration was to show the first years that they were to obey the
second year's command. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Every year it had
become a sort of tradition at the academy. A similar thing had
happened to them when they were first years. A display that there was
a power far greater than them and they were not to become cocky. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To show them that
there was something greater ahead, this would draw them to the fact
that they needed more power. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It would strive for
them to work harder. It was never meant to get this far. At first,
they had given Vorden a simple warning. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Vorden was the
one who first started to attack the second years. At the time Momo
and the others decided to show them his place. They dealt with Vorden
on his own or so they thought. He continued to disobey their commands
and still came after weaker second-year students one by one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That's when they

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn started to
look around at all the second years in the room. There were a total
of eight second-year students standing by the edge of the hall, four
on each side that had around fifty first-year students surrounded.
There were also two students by Vorden, one on each side of the
board. These students were the weakest of the bunch. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each of them had a
power level 2 displayed on the watches. Even though they were second
years they all followed Momo which meant they were weaker than him.
There was the chance that they had already learnt how to use a soul
weapon but it was unlikely. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They had only just
become second years so there wasn't much chance for them to learn
anything. However, the real problem was Momo and the people by his
side. Momo stood there with the power Level of six and the two beside
him where Level fours. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was unlikely that
any of the first years would help Quinn out and even the strongest
first year in the room was Erin and even she was a level five. It was
no wonder even though the first years outnumbered them they were
afraid. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Quinn held the
ball in his hand a message had appeared. </FONT></FONT>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Percentage stood
out to him, it was the same number his gauntlets gave when using
them. Perhaps Quinn didn't need to figure out how to activate the
beast weapons as Momo had said. It seemed like the system would do
everything for him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The black ball
started to glow, it glowed brighter than any of the balls the other
students had held before. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How is that
possible, he was able to activate the basic tier weapon fully?&quot;
Momo thought, &quot;That means its strength has increased by at least
five percent. If he had a higher tier weapon I wonder if he could the
same. Wasn't he just a useless level 1?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then walked in
front of where Vorden was standing. There was now a good five meters
of distance between the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why do we have
these powers.&quot; Quinn said out loud, &quot;Isn't it to protect
ourselves, to fight those who harm our friends and family.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

Quinn's words started to lift his head. he had a feeling he knew what
Quinn was planning to do. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Quinn? No,

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then chucked
the ball using all his strength as hard as he could. With the 16
points of strength and the added 5 percent power, the ball came out
lightning fast as it left his fingertips. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead of the ball
hitting Vorden though like everyone suspected, it landed straight in
the student's stomach standing by the side of the board. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The power was so
strong that the student was lifted off his feet and knocked out in
one blow. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the hell

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn knew there
wasn't much he could do against all the second-year students so he
wanted to create as much havoc as possible. The two-level four
students who stood by Momo side started to come towards him but
instead of Quinn running toward them, he suddenly ran towards the
crowd of first-years behind him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He bent down and
picked up two more of the black balls on the floor and started to
head for the weaker students around the side while weaving in between
the first-year students. Then when he was within distance, he had
found his targets. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once again he threw
out another two black balls aiming for them at full strength, one of
the students managed to avoid the black ball but the other wasn't so
lucky getting hit and knocked out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was Quinn's
plan, so far every level up Quinn was able to obtain an ability, he
didn't know what he would get but he sure hoped it would help him win
the fight. There were enough second-year students for him to take on
to cause a level up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then went back
into the crowd to pick up even more balls while making sure to use
the other students as cover. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What are you
guys doing, to anyone who manages to hit or capture that guy they
will be free from any form of punishment!&quot; Momo said. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first-year
students started to look at each other. They didn't want to be
involved in the first place and were unsure of what to do. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Why should we

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then the
two-level four students who were chasing after Quinn no longer cared
about injuring the first years. The two people started to gather up
their abilities. One of them swung out their arm and with it, a large
line of water came out at them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But before it could

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just then an arrow

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To be honest, at
first, Layla wasn't planning to get involved. If Quinn wanted to take
a beating there was no reason for her to get one with him. However,
she too had experienced mistreatment in the school. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla had no idea

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Inside the assembly
hall, there was one boy who was unsure of what to do and that was
Peter. He had been there the whole time from the very beginning but
chose to hide in the crowd so he wouldn't get picked. When he saw
Quinn come to the stage to try help Vorden, he felt even more guilty.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Why? Because the
whole reason Vorden was tied up on the slab in the first place was
because of him. The other day when the second years came to see
Peter, they had come with a proposal. Help them get Vorden to come to
the assembly hall and he would be protected by the second years. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of course, Peter
felt like he had no choice. If he refused the second years there and
then, they would have tortured him until he agreed anyway. So what
was the use of fighting back if the end result was the same? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After their combat
classes had finished, Peter had asked Vorden to go with him to the
assembly hall to help him further practise. When they entered the
room, the second-year students included Momo where hiding waiting for
him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When the time was
right, they all came out at once and jumped him. But what had
surprised Peter was in that instant, Vorden had turned and pushed
Peter out of the way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Run, I'm sorry
this is all my fault,&quot; Vorden said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden thought the
second years had targeted him because of what he had been doing in
his free time. He had been fighting the second-year students when
they were all on their own, trying to weaken Momo's gang one by one. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Not knowing what to
do, Peter ran out of the room, only later to return with everyone
else. Then when he saw Quinn, someone who was just as weak as him,
stand up to the second years, Peter felt a pain in his heart so
strong. He had betrayed them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Peter was going
to make things right, while no one was looking and everyone attention
was focused on the fights around them, Peter had managed to leave the
assembly hall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Meanwhile, at the
centre of the assembly hall, Erin and Layla were busy confronting the
two-level four students. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The first years had
spread out making sure not to get hurt in the crossfire but at the
same time doing nothing to help. It was unclear who the winner would
be and they felt like if they joined the wrong side it would only
make things worse for them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey, do you
mind if we switch.&quot; One of the second-year students said, &quot;My
water abilities are weak against her?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I see so you
want the level, 2 user, huh.&quot; The other student replied. &quot;Oh
well, just finish her off quickly.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With that, the
two-second years charged in for the attack. The water ability user
went after Layla, while the earth user went after Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the earth user
got closer, he stomped the ground and a spiked earth mound followed,
heading right for Erin. But Erin remained calm, as the spike came
towards her, she slashed her sword and with a single strike, cut the
spike in half causing it to fall to the ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What the? That
beast weapon, if it cut through my earth ability is it an advanced
tier beast weapon?<FONT FACE="Tahoma, serif">���</FONT> The
earth user thought. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, he didn't
have much time to think, with her other hand Erin had formed an ice
spear and threw it towards her opponent. The earth user lifted his
arms causing a wall of earth blocking the attack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He then moved his
hands apart and at the same time the wall he had created, split in
two but when the view in front of him was clear, Erin was nowhere to
be seen. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly, he felt
his legs start to feel cold. When he looked down, he noticed they
were starting to freeze. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;For a
second-year level four earth user, you are incredibly weak.&quot;
Before the boy could react, Erin had whacked him in the back of the
head with the hilt of her sword. Then as he fell to the ground, she
froze his arms and limbs in place making sure he would stay on the
ground. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How did she
win so easy?&quot; The first-year students watching said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah,
shouldn't a match between a level four and five user be closer than
that, and he was a second-year student.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Maybe they
aren<FONT FACE="Tahoma, serif">���</FONT>t as strong as we
thought?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Usually, a fight
with a level four and five users would be a lot closer, especially
considering the other student was a second year. But there was a
major difference between the two fighters and that was something
called, fighting IQ. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No matter how strong
someone's ability was or how powerful a punch they packed, you needed
to know how to use your abilities and when. This could be improved
with experience or some people were just naturally gifted. For Erin,
she had always fallen into the gifted category. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although Erin had
finished her match quickly, the same couldn't be said for Layla. Her
attacks were basically useless. As an archer, her skills were best
used when surprising her opponent and when there was a distance
between the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Here she had neither
of them. Every attack of hers was met with a wall of water that would
stop her arrows in their tracks and finally when she was tired. The
second-year student threw out his fist and a ball of water came out
towards her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It hit her dead in
the stomach and sent her flying back towards the front of the hall
near Vorden. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The water user
started running after her planning to finish her, Layla seeing this
struggled but was to hurt to get up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Hey you, free
me, I can deal with him.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What?&quot;
Layla said as she looked up noticing that it was Vorden who was
speaking to her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on hurry,
we don't have much time, touch my leg.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Layla hesitated for
a moment. She still had remembered what had happened when the two of
them were in the room, she still had an odd feeling in her gut
telling her Vorden was a bad person but right now it was the only
person she could rely on. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She crawled over to
Vorden's side and touched his leg as he had asked. Then the shackles
tied around Vorden's arms and legs started shaking. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Come on, help
me you bitch!&quot; Vorden shouted at her. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden was using
Layal's telekinesis ability but it was weak, it wasn't strong enough
to break from the shackles. Layla then lifted her hand and with the
two of them working together, the shackles were finally removed and
Vorden was free. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He started to rotate
his wrist as if he was getting used to his body. He shook his limbs
out and started to jump up and down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Finally, I get
to come out, it's been a long time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the water user
continued to run forward now that Vorden was free, he was more
cautious. The last time they had fought with him in the assembly hall
they remembered Vorden having earth powers. At the time the last
person he had touched was Peter. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then started
to laugh hysterically and charged towards the water user. It was an
unexpected move, the water user panicked and threw out two lines of
Water blades. These where just as sharp as an attack from a regular
blade but could be thrown out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As the blades came
towards him, at the last second Vorden managed to twist his body in
an odd way avoiding both of the blades. He then lifted one of the
black balls from the ground using his telekinesis and threw it out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However, the attack
was easy for the water user to block, forming a water wall stopping
the ball but then *Crack. Something was felt on the back of his leg
and at the same time a crunching sound was heard, the boy immediately
fell to one knee. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As he looked at
Vorden in front of him, he could only see Vorden with his hands held
out. Then another striking pain was felt through his body, this time
on his other ankle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Without realising
it, Vorden had attacked him from behind, pulling the other black
balls towards him. The water user was two focused on the attack in
front he never thought about an attack from behind. Also, it had come
as a surprise to him that Vorden was not an earth user as he thought.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then lifted
up two more black balls and swung his hands down. At the same time,
the balls came rushing down at a crazy speed hitting the student in
the forearms, breaking them at the same time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The student screamed
in pain and with his arm's mangled, he could no longer use his water
ability as he could before. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second-year

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The attacks

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But he didn't care,
his speed was quick and using the strength in his legs he was able to
move himself forward and grabbed one of the second-year students. He
quickly went behind the student grabbing his arm and at the same time
kept one of his claws towards the student's neck using him as a meat
shield. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The second years
were hesitant to attack afraid they might hit their fellow classmate.
Quinn continued to walk backwards with the student until his back was
up against the wall. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Me and you
both know you're not going to hurt him Quinn.&quot; Momo said, &quot;If
you attack too deep and kill him, you'll be in trouble, attack to
shallow and we will pounce on you and make you wish you were dead.&quot;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quin hated to admit
it but Momo was right, he couldn't kill the student and at the same
time the second he turned his back to them they would take him out so
Quinn was left with only one thing. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>He no longer had his
claw hand out but then started to choke the student from behind
wrapping his arm around his neck. He used his strength and carried on
until he eventually passed out. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No point
wasting good exp,&quot; Quinn said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As soon as the
student fell to the ground the attacks came out fast and furious from
the others. Quinn was able to block most of them now his back was up
against the wall, he started dodging a lot of the strikes, which made
him think back to the test centre. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The situation he was
in was similar to the agility test where holographic spikes came at
him. However, these attacks were more powerful and were greater in
number, eventually, Quinn let a strike get in. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Suddenly the attacks
had stopped and Momo had stood forward with his whip in his hand.
Seeing the Whip Quinn remembered that a single attack last time had
brought his HP down by seven points. If he was to receive another
attack form it right now, he would be brought down to below 0. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn still didn't
know what happened when his HP would reach 0 but at the same time,
this wasn't the time to find out. He had no choice, he would have to
use the blood bank to heal himself. Even if the others did see him
use this, it wouldn't reveal he was a vampire but they would just
think it was some type of self-healing ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The problem was
Quinn had already displayed abnormal strength. If he then displayed
abnormal healing, things wouldn't add up. A student couldn't have two
abilities apart from rare cases, which meant it would only lead to
Quinn being asked more questions. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just as Quinn was
deciding what to do, Momo sensed something and moved his head at the
last second. As he did a black ball came flying through the air and
went past his head, then the black ball stopped mid-air and suddenly
started moving back towards Momo. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Momo lashed his whip
at the ball slicing it in half. As he turned around, he saw Vorden
standing there, when he looked to see what had happened to the rest
of the second years, he could see a few had already been taken down
and those who hadn't been, were busy engaging in combat with Layla
and Erin. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So you got
free huh?&quot; Momo said, &quot;Do you not remember what happened to
you last time the two of us fought?&quot; Momo taunted. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Last time you
fought against that weakling, this time you're fighting me.&quot;
Raten said, &quot;I'm not as nice as Vorden.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Raten lifted both
hands, and with it, two more black balls of the ground lifted up.
Vorden swung his hands in the air and the black balls followed the
same path. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There was no need
for Vorden to use his hands when using his telekinesis ability but it
allowed him to focus his mind better. Doing this moved the balls at
greater speed and precision, after all, he wouldn't be able to use it
as well as Layla who had the ability most her life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The balls flowed a
similar pattern to his hands, Striking at different directions.
However, Momo would simply step forward, move back or turn his body
slightly avoiding each of the balls. He then grew tired and grabbed
one of the balls mid-air that was heading straight for his face. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Looks like you
really don't remember what happened last time?&quot; Momo clenched
his fist tightly destroying the black ball held in his hands. He then
swung his whip destroying the other without even looking where it
was. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn wanted to
help. While Momo's back was turned he tried to go in for a strike but
before he even took a step, the whip came flying out and landed just
in front of him. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Don't even

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before Quinn had
taken a single step, Momo had already acted. Then Quinn waited once
again for the right moment and when he thought it was right, he tried
moving in again but the same thing had happened, Momo swung at his
whip before Quinn had moved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It can't be?&quot;
Quinn thought, So far Momo hadn't displayed anything reviling his
ability but just now and how he had acted before, it seemed like it
was part of his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There were two

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn's guess about
Momo was nearly spot on. Momo could see two seconds ahead into the
future, although it wasn't as clear as others might think. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>His ability was
activated through his eyes. When he turned on his ability a new type
of vision would appear. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Everywhere Momo
looked there was an outline of what a person or object was going to
do next. When Momo's back was turned and the black ball had come
towards him. He could slightly feel the outline of the ball touching
him. Allowing him to move his head just in time. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just two seconds
before Quinn has even begun moving towards Momo, his outline had
already shown where and what Quinn was planning to do. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It was a strong
ability that took years for Momo to get a hang of at first. Just
because one could see the future didn't help out in any other
aspects. Momo strength, speed and reaction time all had to be trained
with his ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Momo's
ability was a rare one that was available on the market place, not
many people opted for it for these reasons. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But Quinn wasn't the
only one who had figured out Momo's ability. Raten had as well. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Who cares if
you know what I'm going to do!&quot; Raten shouted, &quot;All I need
to do, is do something you can't block.&quot; Ratan then started
running towards him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Momo swung his whip,
while Ratan held out his hand slowing the whip down with his
telekinesis ability, the whip slowed down enough allowing him to jump
over the strike. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then with his other
hand, something started to form. It looked like water was starting to
surround his hand. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With another swing,
a water blade followed. Momo quickly moved to the side avoiding one
strike but what quickly followed was a barrage of water strikes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then at the same
time from behind, another two black balls had been lifted and were
coming right at him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Momo could see the
black balls coming at him and he knew he could do nothing but take a
hit. He opted to avoid the water strikes, the more powerful of the
attacks and moved so the balls would hit his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After being hit with
the black balls, Momo moved away from Vorden creating distance
between the two. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I have to
admit, I didn't expect you to be able to use two abilities, you
didn't do something like this last time. It looks like you were
hiding a trump card after all.&quot; Momo said, &quot;But you weren't
the only one holding back last time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While in his right
hand he held a whip, something started to form in his left hand. At
first, it looked just like a bunch of light particles forming
something but then eventually another whip appeared. Only this felt
and looked different, as if it was alive almost. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Just from holding it
alone, the whip would continuously move like a snake. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Let me show
you the difference between the second years and first years,&quot;

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Even though Erin was
currently busy fighting the other second-year students, she couldn't
help but sense the power in the room. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;So he has one,
after all huh, a soul weapon.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While the distance
between Momo and the others were far away, Layla had managed to make
a break and get away from the other second-year students. Honestly,
Erin was doing fine dealing with them on her own and she wasn't much
help in the first place. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>She Quickly went to
Quinn's side and could see he was badly injured. It wasn't so much
that he couldn't move but enough to say he was out of the fight for
now at least. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Do you need
some blood?&quot; Layla whispered. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No I'm fine,
I'm not in any danger don't worry about that, I just don't want to
reveal anything in front of all these people.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I understand,&quot;
Layla said as she then looked at Vorden. &quot;Your friend, I hate to
admit it but he's strong.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah.&quot;
After looking at Vorden now and seeing how he fought so skillfully as
if he had done it a hundred times before and he was even using two
abilities effortlessly. Quinn quickly realised there wasn't much he
knew about Vorden and that he probably had his very own secrets that
he was hiding from everyone similar to himself. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But again, instead
of escaping when he was freed and running away, he had decided to
come help. Although Quinn wasn't strong enough to help now, in the
future he would repay back this kindness. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now with Momo's soul
weapon, the confidence in him grew. He swung his soul whip and it
started to move at lightning speed. In response, Raten created a wall
of water with one hand and started to slow down the whip with the
other but the telekinesis ability was useless and didn't seem to do
anything to slow the whip down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when the whip
had reached the wall of water, it suddenly grew in length and had
wrapped around Raten's arm. Momo pulled forward dragging Ratan to the
ground and then swung out his other whip lashing against his back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Raten tried rolling
to avoid the lashes but it seemed like the whip was following him,
predicting where he would roll to next. Raten had been lashed several
times and now his back was covered in blood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then with Raten's
other hand, he formed a small water blade. He knew that the whip
would be too strong to cut, so instead he went for his own hand
complexly cutting it off from his own body. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The whip was no
longer attached to his body and at the same time so was his hand.
Although unlike one would expect for blood to be drawn everywhere.
Raten was using an absurd amount of energy concentrating to stop his
blood from spewing out from the wound with the telekinesis ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;No problem,&quot;
Peter replied still feeling bad by the whole thing. Although he had
done the right thing by getting Fay, he still felt bad for having
tricked Vorden into going to the hall in the first place. </FONT></FONT>

for one person to pin the blame on.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the head of the
first-year students Nathan, who looked the complete opposite of Duke,
he was small in size and wore glasses, he was always casually dressed
for important occasion which annoyed Duke. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then finally the

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;We are here
today to conduct the meeting on what to do with the second-year
students, who were involved in the case involving primarily the
first-year student known as Vorden Blade and the students who are
part of Del's class and Leo's beast weapons class.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fay then pressed a

generals and the other sergeants, a holographic report was being
displayed to them. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I believe you
have all read the reports but this is here just for your reference. I
would like to ask your opinion on how these students should be
punished, General Duke.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Punished?&quot;
Duke said, &quot;I see no reason for these students to be punished,
if you look at the report it seems like Vorden was the first to
attack the others, they were simply retaliating, these types of
things happen all the time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;But then why
gather the rest of the first-year students?&quot; Nathan casually
added. &quot;It seems like to me other students had gotten involved.
I agree the students fight all time and we purposely do nothing to
stop this but this seemed a little too much, no?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Fine, further
restrictions will be put on the second years and first-year students.
They shall only meet when necessary. I will be in charge of issuing
out the punishments to the second-year students, is that okay with
you Nathan?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Nathan simply
shrugged as if he didn't really care about the matter in the first
place. He had only made his argument to annoy Duke. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I urge the
rest of the Sergeant to take extra precaution.&quot; Said Fay. &quot;It
was only recently we had the death of a student in our school. Unlike
with Brandon, Vorden is an original. If his family was to get
involved in it would not be good for the academy.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Tch, filthy

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The military didn't
have a good impression of Originals. When the war started they were
the ones who risked their lives to save the people of the planet. It
wasn't until it truly looked like the humans would lose the war did
the originals come forward and share their power with everybody and
not even all of them did that. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;I would like
to talk about the matter involving the two students with strange
wounds on their bodies. Were there any reports about a beast escaping
from one of the portals?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Your father,
who is not present at the moment reported that there was no such

Duke replied. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;If it wasn't
the beasts, then just what caused those wounds?&quot; Hayley thought
as she sat back down in her seat. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;How is the
preparation for the portal outing coming along for the first-year
students?&quot; Leo asked. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yes,
everything has been all set up.&quot; Nathan said, &quot;A green

has made preparations for their arrival. It should all go smoothly
next week.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It's best to
ask your students to pack some sun cream and their sunglasses as they
will be arriving on the planet Caladi,&quot; Nathan replied. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Planet Caladi, a
planet that was mostly covered in desert and contained low tier
beasts. Its day cycles were also vastly different compared to that of
earth. Instead of the 24-hour day and night cycle that earth had.
Caladi contained a 72-hour cycle. It was brilliant for those that
loved the sunlight and heat. </FONT></FONT>

willing to help them but each time Peter shook his head. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the end, all five

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Jerry placed
his hand on top of Peter's, and slowly a warm feeling was felt and
the bones in Peter's fingers were starting to take shape. They
reformed to what they once were and he had been healed. </FONT></FONT>

repeated the process again and again. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eventually, after an
hour had passed of breaking, hurting and re healing Peter. Peter's
mind had given in. Without him realising it he no longer wanted to
feel the pain and nodded agreeing to their request. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For a second there

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Relax will

anything, you know Originals rules and all.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden belonged to
one of the Original families that had decided to keep their ability
within their family. Meaning the only people that knew how to copy
other abilities were the Blades. Of course, Vorden wasn't allowed to
talk to anyone about their ability. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Yeah, sorry

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The two of them
continued to walk down the high street which was filled with shops,

them headed inside and there were all types of games filled on the

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At the very back of
the shop was a VR pod for people to test out before they bought
anything. Just like everything else, even the gaming technology had
improved significantly after the war. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Vorden pointed
at the VR capsule. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;You see that
thing, I grew up playing on that.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What?&quot;
Quinn thought, but then Quinn remembered Leo mentioning something
about a VR game that was popular between students. He said if he
wanted to get fighting experience it would be good if he played a
certain game, is this what he was talking about? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There's a
popular game played in the outside world and within the military
schools called Power fighter. The game is simple, it gives you an
open empty room and the two of you fight until one loses. Although it
sounds simple the game itself is used to help people train. The VR
capsule can record all attributes of your body. Anything you do in
the real world you can do in the game. The only thing that it can't
do is record your ability.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Vorden then walked
up to the capsule and touched the front of the capsule where there
was a round ring. A holographic display appeared with the game's
settings on the top. Vorden then placed his hand on the holographic
display and a notification sound was heard. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Welcome User
ID VBCopy.&quot; The machine said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As Vorden logged
into the game, his user ID's information could be seen along with a
dummy model of his fighter which looked nothing like Vorden. It
displayed the total amount of fights Vorden had, and how many wins
and losses. Although Vorden quickly went of that screen on to
another, too quick for Quinn to see anything. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then Vorden was
suddenly on an ability tab. The list seemed almost endless. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Wait I thought
you said the game couldn't record your ability?&quot; Quinn asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It can't, but
so the game was even more realistic and so it could be used a
training tool, it uploads into its database every ability that is
shared out there in the world that we know today. Of course, only the
ones that are made public. So Original abilities and abilities that
have yet to be discovered aren't on this list, including my own.
However, I can select any ability I want, even if I can't perform it
in the real world I can practice with it in the game.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn finally
understood how Vorden was able to become well adverse with multiple
different abilities. This was something that would only greatly
benefit someone like him who was able to use whatever ability he
wished. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most people who were
playing the game would want to get stronger and better at using their
abilities. That meant they would usually only select their own
ability, what was the point of selecting something that you could
never use in the real world, unless you just wanted to have the
experience. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The game is
actually very popular with the other military schools.&quot; Vorden
continued to explain. &quot;So much so that the military has designed
its own servers so it only connects to other schools but you can also
just play with the outside world as well. Before you enter the game
you can even input your power level. This way it will match you with
those people around the same level. People can lie about their level
but those type of people will never get better at fighting, bullying
those weaker than them all the time.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn then walked up
to the capsule and started to inspect it. It sounded amazing and was
exactly what Quinn needed. This way he was able to practise against
other students without others realising it was him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then when Quinn
lifted up the tag on it, there were more zeros on the thing then he
had ever seen before. There was no way he could afford such a thing.
Maybe some of the other students who could be sent credits from their
family but not Quinn. </FONT></FONT>
